Release Notes for DTN2
----------------------

0.1 (Dec 2004):
---------------
- first public "release" -- while the design and structure is expected
  to remain relatively stable, there are still numerous features left
  to be implemented

- note about namespaces -- we will eventually put all of the oasys and
  dtn code into namespaces. this process is partially complete at
  present. the code is annotated with XXX/namespace comments to
  reflect this
