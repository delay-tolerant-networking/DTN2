DTN Reference Implementation Simulator
======================================

This directory contains the source code for the DTN simulation
environment.

[March 2012]
After some years of (probable) non-functioning, the simulator has been
repaired.  Added expiration parameter to simulator registrations (defaults
to 10 seconds).

[Note from 2004!]
NOTE: the framework is still in a pre-release state. Internal APIs and
structures will likely change in upcoming revisions.
