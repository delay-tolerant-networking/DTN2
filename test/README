To start new experiment type:
./gen-emu.sh and follow instructions


TO see execution of your program that is called do 
./base-cmd.sh and follow instructions


User interaction for starting experiment:

gen-emu.sh: allows u to set various parameters for the experiment
	this uses  base-emu.tcl
	which has all the meat of setting up TCL topology for emulab

Program objects work in the following fashion:

the TCL calls:

base-cmd.sh with args inside file
the base-cmd.sh
will call  TCP-Half-command.sh or DTN-half-command.sh depending
upn the protocol that is specified



Loggin is set in base-cmd.sh


mostly: gen-emu.sh and super-base-cmd are very simple things
for indirection.

note that base-emu.sh only refs to super-base-cmd <filename>
