.SH NAME
dtnrecv \- receive DTN bundles
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dtnrecv 
.I endpoint

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dtnrecv
receives a bundle and prints it on standard output.
To do this, it connects
to a dtnd daemon using the DTN API. It registers to receive
bundles with the 
.IR endpoint
from the commandline. It then blocks,
waiting on bundles to arrive from dtnd. It terminates on SIGTERM
(Ctrl-C).
 
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\^h
Print a one-line help message and exit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B DTNAPI_ADDR
If
.B DTNAPI_ADDR
is set, 
.B dtnrecv
uses it as the hostname to connect to for DTN API operations.
.TP
.B DTNAPI_PORT
If
.B DTNAPI_PORT
is set, its value is used as the TCP port to connect to
for DTN API operations.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
dtnsend(1), dtnd(8).
.SH BUGS
.B dtnrecv
mixes diagnostic output with the bundles themselves on standard
output, and generally makes no effort to be useful when called from 
other programs in a pipeline. It is most useful at this point as
a diagnostic tool and as example code.
