.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dtnrespond
listens for incoming query bundles. To do this,
it connects to a dtnd daemon using the DTN API.
It registers to receive bundles with the 
.IR end‚Äêpoint
from the command line. It then blocks, waiting on
bundles to arrive from dtnd. It terminates on SIGTERM (Ctrl-C)
or after n query bundles have been received.
.PP
On receiving a query bundle
.B dtnrespond
will attempt to match the query based on the contents of the 
.IR matching_file
and will return the result (if available) to the source eid
of the query bundle.

Returns 1 if there was an error processing the arguments.
Otherwise 
.B dtnrespond
returns 0.

.SH OPTIONS

The matching_file is a comma seperated value file that contains 
information on the files to match against. See
