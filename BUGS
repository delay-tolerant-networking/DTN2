Known bugs in the DTN2 reference implementation
===============================================

* If an opportunistic link goes down while in the middle of sendings
  one or more bundles, the table based router never cancels the
  transmission on that link in order to potentially re-route the
  bundles onto another link.

* Occasionally the stream-based convergence layers get stuck in the
  BUSY state even though there are no bundles in flight. A temporary
  workaround relies on a timer to reopen the link but the root cause
  of this problem still needs to be worked out.

* If a large number of bundles are queued on a Link that does not
  implement persistent link queues and the link goes down, then when
  the link reopens, the main BundleDaemon calls send_bundle for all of
  the queued bundles. This may cause the link to immediately become
  BUSY, so the contact isn't really up.
