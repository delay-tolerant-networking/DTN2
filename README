DTN Reference Implementation
============================

Compilation / Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

./configure
make
make install

Note that by default, the configure script will also run configure
inside the oasys/ subdirectory. If this results in an error, run
configure manually within that directory.

If you need to make changes to the configure.ac script or one of
the helper scripts in aclocal/*.ac, run build-configure.sh to
recreate configure and then check in both your changes as well
as the newly generated configure script.

Reporting Bugs / Other Help
---------------------------
As of this release, there is no bug tracking system in place. Please
direct questions and/or bug reports to dtn-bugs@mailman.dtnrg.org.
