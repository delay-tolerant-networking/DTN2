DTN Reference Implementation
============================

Compilation / Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

./configure -C
make
make install

Note that by default, the configure script will also run configure
inside the oasys/ subdirectory. The -C argument enables the autoconf
variable cache, which speeds up configuration. 

Note that if you need to make changes to the configure.ac script or
one of the helper scripts in aclocal/*.ac, run build-configure.sh to
recreate configure and then check in both your changes as well as the
newly generated configure script.

Getting Started
---------------

A good place to start for playing around with DTN is to look at the
manual and tutorials (see doc/manual/index.html). This set of
documentation explains some of the configuration and applications. If
you find omissions or errors, please feel free to post updates and
corrections to dtn-bugs@mailman.dtnrg.org.

Reporting Bugs / Other Help
---------------------------
As of this release, there is no bug tracking system in place. Please
direct questions and/or bug reports to dtn-bugs@mailman.dtnrg.org.
