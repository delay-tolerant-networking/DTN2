DTN Reference Implementation
============================

This is the Delay Tolerant Networking reference implementation. See
the file STATUS for an overview of the state of the code, particularly
in reference to the various internet drafts and (someday) RFCs that
describe the bundling protocol. Also, the file RELEASE-NOTES describes
major changes in each release. 

Compilation / Installation Instructions
---------------------------------------

./configure -C
make
make install

Note that by default, the configure script will also run configure
inside the oasys/ subdirectory. The -C argument enables the autoconf
variable cache, which speeds up configuration. 

Note that if you need to make changes to the configure.ac script or
one of the helper scripts in aclocal/*.ac, run build-configure.sh to
recreate configure and then check in both your changes as well as the
newly generated configure script.

Getting Started
---------------

A good place to start for playing around with DTN is to look at the
manual and tutorials (see doc/manual/index.html). This set of
documentation explains some of the configuration and applications. If
you find omissions or errors, please feel free to post updates and
corrections to dtn-users@mailman.dtnrg.org.

Reporting Bugs / Other Help
---------------------------
A bug tracking system is in place. Please direct bug reports to 
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=101657&atid=630167 and
direct questions to dtn-bugs@mailman.dtnrg.org.

External Requirements
---------------------
oasys-1.3.0+ (see Note - Oasys)
gcc/g++

Optional External Packages
--------------------------
bonjour

Optional Internal Packages
--------------------------
NORM convergence layer support
Bundle Security Protocol support (see Note BSP)
LTP convergence layer support via TCD's LTPlib
Internet Draft Compliant IP Neighbor Discovery (see README.IPND)


Note - Oasys
--------------------------
Before compiling DTN2 please compile Oasys-1.3.0+ (must be 
installed or located in DTN2 or ../). Support for the
following DTN2 options should be specified when configuring
oasys

specify location / support of:
    
    Python 
    tcl                  
    google perftools
    expat
    xerces-c
    xsd tool
    Berkeley DB                  
    mysql 
    postgres             

compile with or without support for:

    bluetooth 
    zlib 
    tclreadline
    profiling
    google profiling
    assembly-based atomic functions

enable or disable:

    oasys debugging
    oasys memory debugging
    oasys lock debugging
    oasys optimization


Note - BSP
--------------------------
The standard ciphersuites require, amongst other things, 
an implementation of sha-256 message digest algorithm.

The DTN reference code uses OpenSSL for cryptographic
and related functions. Unfortunately, some versions of
OpenSSL do not include sha-256.

The "configure" process checks for the availability of
sha-256 and provides an error if it is not found.

If your system's OpenSSL does not have sha-256 then you 
can either upgrade it or build and use a local  version 
of OpenSSL. OpenSSL can be obtained from
http://www.openssl.org

OpenSSL 0.9.8 version include sha-256 by default. If your
system uses version 0.9.7 and you do not wish to upgrade
then you can enable sha-256 in later versions of 0.9.7,
such as 0.9.7l and 0.9.7m. To enable sha-256, specify "fips"
when running "Configure".

If you wish to leave you system installation untouched and
build against a local version, then configure dtn using
./configure --with-bsp --with-openssl=/path/to/openssl

Mac OS X note: for Mac OS X users ONLY. If you build dtn
against a local OpenSSL using "--with-openssl=/path/to/openssl"
you MUST also specify with it LDFLAGS="-Wl,-search_paths_first". 
The configuration for OS X users would then be 
./configure --with-bsp --with-openssl=/path/to/openssl LDFLAGS="-Wl,-search_paths_first"
Note that the quotes are required for the LDFLAGS argument.

Note - LTP
----------------------------

This is an initial test of TCD's LTPlib as a CL. To 
use it go get LTPlib (todo: add URL!) and then 
./configure --with-ltp
