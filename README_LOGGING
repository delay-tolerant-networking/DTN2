README for DTN Logging
======================

The logging in DTN is organized into hierarchical paths. A partially
complete list of the targets is below. In the .dtndebug file, specific
targets can be enabled at the various logging levels. In addition,
classes that inherit from the oasys::Logger base class also pass the
class name to the log system, allowing logging to be enabled for the
specific class as well as the hierarchical section. 

See comments in oasys/debug/{Log,Logger}.h for a more in-depth
explanation.
