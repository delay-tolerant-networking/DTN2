Reference Implementation Discussion Notes
Wednesday, May 26, 2004
-----------------------------------------

Convergence Layers --> Data Plane, Control Plane
* not dynamically loadable
* not required to be reliable
    - configurable? (eg by granularity of precision, or reliable/not reliable)
* not required to have a control part
    - but it *is* and option (eg by inheritance)
* standard set of convergence layers
    - TCP, UDP, URL/website
    - sneakernet, USB, UUCP
    - SCTP
    - bluetooth (should this be over TCP?)
* IDs for connections/whatever
* Routing function passes connection object from control to data?

Control Plane: responsible for neighbor bundle node discovery
Data Plane: responsible for delivering bundle to next bundle hop

Application - LPC
* some IPL mechanism
* we are still not well informed enough about
LPC/marshalling/serialization systems
* is there a portable shared memory system?
* investigate capabilities of IDL, DCE, and XDR
* keshav's suggested remedies (boost, post++)
* desire for standardized "flat" format for communication

Bundling Components
* Routing Lookup
* Routing Protocol
* Forwarding/Delivery
* Scheduling
* Persistent Object Storage --> bundle, state, refs, registrations?
* Timers
     - bundle expiration
     - custody
* Fragmentation
* Security
* Management Interface
* Implementation of User API
* Debug Interface
* Configuration Parser
* Registration
* Adjacency Detection
* Events?

Database/Object Storage 
* high level API (getExpiredBundles() vs select(bundles,
where=expiration < now))
* event-based?
* ability to support different underlying databases
   - berkeleyDB, DHTs?, postgres, mysql, ODBC
