<b>I. Introduction</b>

This document covers the requirements for the fragmentation interface, as 
integrated with the bundle processing.

Our main goals are to be able to (i) fork a bundle across multiple links and
(ii) send a bundle over the same link using multiple contacts (assuming the
contact disconnects and reconnects later). A secondary goal is to integrate
digital fountain so we can have a sort of hop-by-hop error control.

There is a main assumption that the routing layer will contain and control all
knowledge about the fragmentation capabilities of other dtn gateways and 
routers, so it can make essential fragmentation decisions.

<b>II. Design Overview</b>

In terms of basic mechanics, the Fragmentation Manager knows how to create 
fragments from an original bundle, as well as how to create a bundle from
its constituent fragments.  When the bundle to be fragmented is ready to be
scheduled for delivery, the Routing Layer will make a decision as to 
how the bundle should be fragmented, and on which channel(s) the fragments 
should be sent. Once the fragment it on a particular channel, it is treated
exactly like any other bundle. Upon receipt of a bundle fragment, it is
funnelled into the Fragment Manager, until we know that a bundle can be 
reconstructed. At this point, the bundleDaemon will reconstruct the bundle
and treat it as if had just been received from the convergence layer.

We would also like the Fragmentation Manager to be stateless, so information
about the fragments should be stored in its own persistent database table.

<b>III. Functional Requirements</b>

M - Must Have
S - Should Have
C - Could Have
W - Want to Have

DF: related to digital fountain feature (raptor codes)
FRAG: fragmentation without digital fountain
CUST: related to custody transfer
REAC: related to reactive/dynamic fragmentation

<u>A. Routing Layer Changes</u>

RA1 S) For a particular route and convergence layer,
     a S) determine necessary level of redundancy needed to increase 
        probability of end-to-end delivery (or just next hop), which may 
        depend on characteristics of underlying protocol
     b M) Decide what type and level of fragmentation is feasible
        - Could choose none, if underlying layer takes care of it properly
        - DF vs FRAG, or combination of two (DF some fragments)
            - could choose to FRAG, then DF portions if especially large file
            - could choose to DF, and then FRAG code blocks, if downstream
              links need fragments smaller than ~16 bytes
            - could choose only one or another
            - based on endpoint capability - does it support DF?
                - oracle: list of known df-capable routers
                - possibly based on entity part of tuple
        - choose maximum fragment size (MFS)
            - default to what is reasonable for the next hop
            - decide what is the largest block size that can be sent over
              all of the known expected hops in the route, based on 
              the medium and protocols that will be used
            - only need to fragment up to next "layover", can reassemble and
              fragment downstream when it is being buffered. (e.g. fragment
              during the DakNet bus ride)
        - DF: Choose how many coding blocks we need (what factor)
            - estimate downstream loss rate, and produce 
              (s*1.05 + 800)/mfs x (1 + loss rate) fragments, where
              s is the number of bytes in the file, and mfs is the size of
              the coding block.
            - based on past history from custody transfers?
            - pre-determined fixed value based on prior monitoring (more
              for scheduled contacts, but also for on-average homogeneous
              performance)
            - this is basically error control!
RA2 M) Given a bundle and a particular route, do the following:
   a M) Decide if fragmentation is necessary (or error coding)
   b M) Choose appropriate fragmentation, based on bundle size, MFS
   c M) if bundle is too big, fragment according to specification
RA3 W) Given a bundle, send fragments along different routes/channels
RA4 M) CUST: Upon custody ACK, stop sending fragments, and clear rtx buffers
RA5 M) CUST: Upon retransmission timeout, send fragments out again 
     a S) CUST/DF: If custody transfer timeout occurs, retransmit bundle using
      a new set of pseodorandom keys. (Rather than duplicating data)
     b S) FRAG: same fragments
     c W) FRAG: guess which fragments haven't been recieved
     d C) Optionally choose a new route (or set of routes)
RA6 S) REAC: Upon unexpected termination of contact 
     a W) recalculate route for remaining packets, and shift to new
        contact queue. This entails shifting bundles back out of the 
        convergence layer and into the bundle layer again.
     b S) DF: upon reconnect, just continue sending messages from new q
     c S) FRAG: upon reconnect send rest of fragments, then maybe fragments 
        that have we guess may have dropped because connection terminated just 
        prior to their sending. (pseudo-FEC)
     Note: This implies that the queues are managed on in the routing layer
     rather than the convergence layer, or that we implement
     revocation - allowing the routing layer to tell the convergence layer
     that it no longer needs to send specific pending bundles or bundle 
     fragments.
RA7 M) Identify bundles as fragments, and decide where it should go:
     a M) Fragmentation Manager if we need to reassemble, may choose to do this
        always if all contacts are idle or busy.
     b S) Immediate relay if contact is open, and fragment size is okay
     c M) Buffer fragments until sufficient to assume custody
       - DF: original_size * 1.05 + 800 bytes, rounded up to nearest
         encoding unit size multiple
       - FRAG: reassemble packet to verify all bytes
     d M) Fragment if packet too large for downstream route
     e M) If bundle fragment has arrived at last hop, wait for rest of bundle
        so it can be reassembled prior to delivery. (i.e. Applications do 
        not get fragments.)
RA8 S) Recall fragments from Fragmentation Manager if a new contact has 
      arrived and we can relay immediately.
      ?) Are bundle fragments copied to manager from routing layer?
      ?) Does routing layer track which fragments are in fragmentation manager?
      ?) Should requests for fragments be non-blocking? Should routing layer
        request to send fragments, or should fragmentation manager ask routing
        layer to send fragments as they are ready?
RA9 S) Identify and process partial custody ACKs 
     a S) upon custody transfer timeout, only retransmit portions that are not
        ACKed
     b S) if entire bundle has been ACKed by same custodian, then allow 
        custody transfer
RA10 M) Generate bundle status report for bundle, if requested.
     S) Generate report of which fragments received
     C) Set timer, so receipt of multiple fragments can be placed in
          single report
RA11 M) Track which bundles are being reassembled, and assembly status
      a M) DF: decoding is optional, can just gather fragments and count
      b M) FRAG: produce partial ACK report
RA12 M) Request fragments for a particular bundle, specifying maximum fragment
      size, fragmentation type, number of fragments needed (if DF), seed for
      pseudo random generator (if DF), offset start/end (if FRAG)
      - callback, routing layer registers request, and frag mgr delivers
        bundle fragments as they are ready
      - if relaying DF fragments, MFS and seed are not necessary
RA13 M) Tell Fragmentation Manager when it can clean up fragments for a 
      given bundle.
RA14 W) Replicate or Split fragments for a given bundle across multiple
      channels to increase probability or speed of delivery.

<u>B. Fragmentation Manager</u>

RB1 M) Accept New Bundle and Fragmentation request.
RB2 M) Accept requests for fragments for bundles that arrived as fragments
RB3 M) Generate Bundle Fragments using Raptor Codes (DF)
      - optional initial seed parameter for key generator
      - code block size specified by routing layer
      - fragments include key, source size, and data (as payload)
      - if code blocks are not subdivisible, then code block size is 40 bytes
        and bundle fragments may carry multiple code blocks
RB4 M) Generate Bundle Fragments using Basic Fragmentation (FRAG)
      - fragment segment size specified by routing layer
      - fragments include source size, fragment offset, and data (as payload)
      - allow fragmentation to begin from a specific offset
RB5 S) FRAG: Generate Bundle Fragments from partial assembly
      - in case not all fragments have been received, allow fragment creation
RB7 M) Accept and Track Fragments from routing layer
      a M) DF: Maintain fragment count, keep fragments generated using
           different encoding unit sizes separated 
      b M) DF: Remove duplicate fragments
      c M) CUST: Notify Routing layer if sufficient fragments have been 
           recieved to accept custody (based on parameters provided by routing 
           layer, and if custody has been requested)
      d M) CUST: Update custody id of each fragment once custody is accepted
      e M) FRAG: Order fragments, and track which bytes have arrived
RB8 M) Reassemble Bundle from received fragments (DF/FRAG)
RB9 M) Allow relay of existing fragments (no assembly/refragmenting)
RB10 W) REAC: Reactive Fragmentation - buffer fragments or partial payload 
      until contact resumes.
RB11 M) Garbage collection
      - remove fragments for bundles that have already been sent
      - remove fragments for expired bundles

<u>Remaining Questions</u>

* Can we fragment pre-encoded blocks further by splitting the information
  in such a way that the <i>code block fragments</i> are still useful to the 
  decoder?
    - retain key, source size, and original encoding block size
    - include offset of this code block fragment
* If not, is there a value add to fragmenting as small as possible and 
  including multiple code blocks in a given bundle fragment?
    - suggested "quantum" code block size is 40 bytes
* If we split a bundle across multiple channels, how does custody transfer 
  work?
* Should we allow partial ACKs for custody transfer? 
* Where/how should fragment queueing occur? - currently managed by routing
  layer, with the fragmentation functionality being stateless
* Could we reduce fragment overhead by only sending the duplicate headers
  with some subset of the fragments? Thus, fragments 0, 5, and 10 will carry
  the original headers, and the rest will carry some matching hash identifier.
  This reduces the duplicate information being sent out....

<b>III. Non-Functional Requirements</b>

NF1 ?) The Fragmentation Manager should be stateless
       - client handles filesystem and memory allocation
NF2 M) Maximize the utility of contacts by sending fragments of packets
       and reassembling them later. (see RA14)
NF3 S) Consider resource limitations.
NF4 M) Digital Fountain encode/decode functionality must be optional
       - we may require routers to be df-aware?

<b>IV. Header Specification</b>

There will be two headers for fragments, one for traditional fragmentation
and another for Digital Fountain Bundle Fragments.

<u>Standard Bundle Fragment Header</u>

   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
   |  Next Header   |  Length of original bundle payload (4 bytes) 
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
                    |  Offset of this bundle fragment (4 bytes)         
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+ 
                    | 
   -----------------+ 

   Bundle fragment headers are present in all bundle fragments whose 
   offsets from the beginning of the original bundle are non-zero.  
   Bundle fragment headers MAY also appear in bundles whose offsets from 
   the beginning of the original bundle are zero. 
    
   The fields of the Bundle Fragment Header are: 
    
   Next Header Type. The Next Header Type field is a 1-byte field that 
          indicates the type of the header that immediately follows this 
          one.  Header types are listed in Table 1 above. 
    
   Length of Original Bundle Payload.  This is the total length of the 
          original bundle's payload before any fragmentation. 
    
   Fragment Offset.  The byte offset of the beginning of this fragment 
          within the original bundle. 
    
   Note: The length of the fragment itself is included in the Bundle
   Payload Header. 

<u>Digital Fountain Bundle Fragment Header (Proposed Version A)</u>

   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
   |  Next Header   |  Length of original bundle payload (4 bytes) 
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
                    |  Code Block Size (4 bytes)         
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+ 
                    |  Number of Code Blocks (4 bytes)         
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+ 
                    | 
   -----------------+ 

   Digital Fountain Bundle Fragment Headers appear in all bundles where 
   the payload consists of one or more raptor-encoded coded blocks.
    
   The fields of the Bundle Fragment Header are: 
    
   Next Header Type. The Next Header Type field is a 1-byte field that 
          indicates the type of the header that immediately follows this 
          one.  Header types are listed in Table 1 above. 
    
   Length of Original Bundle Payload.  This is the total length of the 
          original bundle's payload before any fragmentation. 
    
   Code Block Size.  This is the size of the encoding unit.

   Number of Code Blocks.  This is the number of code blocks included in
          the payload.

    
   Note: The bundle payload in this case MUST consist of a series of code
   blocks, each preceded by a 4 byte key corresponding to the key used 
   to generate the code block. This key determines the graph used to encode
   the data in the code block. The size of the payload will be a multiple of
   4 bytes + the code block size.

<u>Digital Fountain Bundle Fragment Header (Proposed Version B)</u>

   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
   |  Next Header   |  Length of original bundle payload (4 bytes) 
   +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ 
                    |  Code Block Size (4 bytes)         
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+ 
                    |  Code Block Key (4 bytes)
   +----------------+--------------------------------------------------+ 
                    | 
   -----------------+ 

   Digital Fountain Bundle Fragment Headers appear in all bundles where 
   the payload consists of one or more raptor-encoded coded blocks.
    
   The fields of the Bundle Fragment Header are: 
    
   Next Header Type. The Next Header Type field is a 1-byte field that 
          indicates the type of the header that immediately follows this 
          one.  Header types are listed in Table 1 above. 
    
   Length of Original Bundle Payload.  This is the total length of the 
          original bundle's payload before any fragmentation. 
    
   Code Block Size.  This is the size of the encoding unit.

   Code Block Key. This key uniquely identifies the code block and is used
          as the key for determining the graph used to generate this code
          block.

   Note: The bundle payload in this case MUST be a digital-fountain encoded
   code block of the size specified as the code block size.

   Thoughts: We could eliminate the Code Block Size field and make that
   implicit in the bundle payload length specified in that header. This 
   version differs from (A) in that there is only one code block per
   bundle fragment.

<b>Glossary</b>

<u>code block</u> - a set of bits generated using digital fountain's raptor 
codes that can be used with other blocks to decode an encoded payload.

<u>key</u> - the number used to pseudo-randomly generate the degree and
connections for a given block. Also can be used as a unique identifier

<u>custody id</u> - the tuple of the current custodian of the bundle 
or bundle fragment

<u>custody timeout</u> - if the current custodian has not received a custody
ack within this time, the custodian must retransmit the bundle

<u>custody ack</u> - when a downstream custodian decides to accept custody
of a particular bundle, it sends an ack to the current custodian, so it can
release custody

<u>partial custody ack</u> - if a downstream custodian only has a fragment
of the original bundle (or some percentage of the DF fragments) then it can
send a partial custody ack, telling the current custodian that it accepts the
custody of those fragments

<u>fragmentation manager</u> - encapsulation of the code that knows how to
break bundles into bundle fragments, and how to reassemble them
