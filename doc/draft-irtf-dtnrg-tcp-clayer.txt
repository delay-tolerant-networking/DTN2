1.  Introduction

   This document describes the protocol used when implementing a TCP
   Convergence Layer, as described in the Architecture for Delay
   Tolerant Networking [2] (DTN).

   Note that this document describes version 2 of the protocol.  Version
   1 was never specified in an Internet Draft or other public document,
   although it was implemented in the DTN reference implementation [3]
   versions 2.0.1 and 2.0.2.

   Communication between two Bundle daemons using the TCP Convergence
   Layer is initiated by one daemon opening a TCP session via the normal
   TCP connection establishment mechanism (i.e.  the connect() call in
   the BSD sockets API).  This operation establishes a new TCP session
   between the two nodes, herein termed a "connection".

   In this protocol, one side of the connection is termed the "sender"
   and one side is the "receiver".  All bundle transmissions occur in
   only one direction, from sender to receiver.  However, other messages
   are transmitted from receiver to sender, as described below.  In
   addition, as will be described in Section 10, the party that
   initiates the TCP connection is not necessarily the sender.

   XXX something about byte order

2.  Contact Header

   When a connection is established between a sender and receiver, both
   parties MUST transmit a Contact Header upon establishing a
   connection.

Internet-Draft       TCP Bundling Convergence Layer           March 2005


   The format for the Contact Header is as follows:

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                          magic='dtn!'                         |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |     version   |     flags     |        partial_ack_len        |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |        idle_close_time        |       keepalive_interval      |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                    Figure 1: Contact Header Format

   The fields of the contact header are:

   magic: A four byte field that always contains the byte sequence 0x64
        0x76 0x6e 0x21, i.e.  the ASCII string "dtn!".

   version: A one byte field value containing the current version of the
        protocol.

   flags: A one byte field containing optional connection flags.  The
        first five bits are unused and must be set to zero.  The last
        three bits are interpreted as follows.

        +-------+----------------------------------------------+
        | Value |                    Meaning                   |
        +-------+----------------------------------------------+
        |  001  | Request acknowledgement of bundle reception. |
        |  010  |        Request reactive fragmentation.       |
        |  100  |     Connection initiator is the receiver.    |
        +-------+----------------------------------------------+

                     Table 1: Contact Header Flags

   partial_ack_len: A two byte field containing the length in bytes for
        which partial reception acknowledgements are requested (see
        Section 7).

   idle_close_time: A two byte field containing the number of seconds
        that a connection should be maintained when no data (bundles or
        acknowledgements) are being exchanged (see Section 9).

   keepalive_interval: A two byte field containing the number of seconds
        between exchanges of keepalive messages on the connection (see
        Section 8).

3.  Magic number and version validation

   Upon receipt of the contact header from the other side, both the
   sender and receiver follow the following semantics for validating the
   the value of each connection flag and parameter.

   If either side does not send the correct magic string, the connection
   MUST be terminated.  The intent of the magic string is to provide
   some more apparent protection against an inadvertent connection to a
   TCP convergence layer.  To prevent a flood of repeated connections,
   either side MAY choose to hold an invalid connection open for some
   time before closing it.

   If one party receives a version number that is greater than that
   node's current version of the protocol, the receiving party SHOULD
   interpret all received fields as if the sending party was conforming
   to the node's current version.  For the party that receives a version
   number that is smaller than the node's current version, the node MAY
   conform to the older version of the protocol or the node MAY
   terminate the connection.

4.  Message Type Codes

   After the initial exchange of a contact header, all messages
   transmitted over the connection are preceded by a one byte message
   type code.

   The types and values for the message type code are as follows.

   +-------------+------+----------------------------------------------+
   |    Header   | Type | Comment                                      |
   +-------------+------+----------------------------------------------+
   | BUNDLE_DATA | 0x01 | Precedes the transmission of a Bundle Data   |
   |             |      | Header, which itself precedes the            |
   |             |      | transmission of a Bundle.                    |
   |  BUNDLE_ACK | 0x02 | Precedes the transmission of a Bundle        |
   |             |      | Acknowledgement Header.                      |
   |  KEEPALIVE  | 0x03 | Described in Section 8.                      |
   |   SHUTDOWN  | 0x04 | Indicates that the transmitting side of the  |
   |             |      | connection wishes to cleanly terminate the   |
   |             |      | connection.                                  |
   +-------------+------+----------------------------------------------+

5.  Bundle Data

   The sender side transmits a bundle to the receiver side by first
   transmitting a BUNDLE_DATA message code, and then transmitting a
   Bundle Data Header.

   The format for the Bundle Data Header and the preceding type is as
   follows.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+
   | BUNDLE_DATA   |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           bundle_id                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                         bundle_length                         |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |         header_length         |          __unused__           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

                  Figure 2: Bundle Data Header Format

   The fields of the bundle data header are:

   bundle_id: A four byte field that contains an identifier for the
        bundle at the sender.  The format and specification for this
        field is implementation specific.

   bundle_length: A four byte field the contains the total length of the
        bundle transmission that immediately follows.

   header_length: A two byte field the contains the total length of the
        bundle transmission that follows the bundle data header.

   __unused__: A two byte field that is ignored.

   Immediately following the Bundle Data Header is the transmission of a
   bundle, as specified in XXX cite bundle protocol.

6.  Bundle Acknowledgements

   When sending acknowledgements of receipt of data, the receiver side
   of the connection first transmits a BUNDLE_ACK message type code and
   then transmits a Bundle Acknowledgement Header.

Internet-Draft       TCP Bundling Convergence Layer           March 2005


   The format for the Bundle Acknowledgement Header and the preceding
   type code is as follows.

                        1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +---------------+
   |  BUNDLE_ACK   |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                           bundle_id                           |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   |                          acked_length                         |
   +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+

             Figure 3: Bundle Acknowledgement Header Format

   The fields of the bundle acknowledgement header are:

   bundle_id: A four byte field that contains the identifier for the
        bundle at the sender that was transmitted in the bundle data
        header.

   acked_length: A four byte field the contains the total length (in
        bytes) of the amount of data that has been successfully received
        and is being acknowledged.

   If, during the exchange of contact headers, BOTH the sender and
   receiver set the bundle_ack_enabled flag (see Section 2), then the
   receiver MUST transmit a bundle acknowledgement header when it
   successfully receives the entire bundle.

7.  Partial Bundle Acknowledgements

   The protocol also includes a provision for bundle acknowledgements to
   be transmitted during the course of receiving a bundle.  The
   motivation behind this feature is to enable the bundle daemon to
   communicate state knowledge to enable "reactive fragmentation", as
   described in Section 11.

   As described in Section 2, one of the parameters in the contact
   header is the partial_ack_len.  The sender populates this field with
   a requested length (in bytes), and the receiver populates the field
   with an offered length (in bytes).  The two parties agree that the
   negotiated value is the MAXIMUM of the two lengths.  However, if
   either side sets the length to be zero, then the feature is disabled
   and no partial acknowledgements are transmitted.

   If the two parties agree to a non-zero value of the partial_ack_len
   parameter, then the receiver SHOULD transmit a bundle acknowledgement

   (see Section 6) whenever it receives at least partial_ack_len
   additional bytes of the bundle payload since the last acknowledgement
   transmission (or the start of the bundle if no acknowledgements have
   been sent).

8.  Keepalive Messages

   The protocol includes a provision for transmission of keepalive
   messages over the TCP connection to determine if the connection has
   been disrupted.

   As described in Section 2, one of the parameters in the contact
   header is the keepalive_interval.  Both sides populate this field
   with their requested intervals (in seconds) between keepalive
   messages.  The two parties SHOULD set the negotiated interval to the
   MAXIMUM value of the two requests.  If either side sets the interval
   to zero, then this feature is disabled and no keepalive messages
   should be sent.

   The format of a keepalive message is a one byte message type code of
   KEEPALIVE (as described in Table 2, with no additional data.  Both
   sides SHOULD send a keepalive message whenever the negotiated
   interval has elapsed without transmission of any message (keepalive
   or other).

   If no message (keepalive or other) has been received for at least
   twice the keepalive interval, then either party MAY terminate the
   session by transmitting a one byte message type code of SHUTDOWN (as
   described in Table 2) and closing the TCP connection.

9.  Idle Connection Shutdown

   The protocol includes a provision for clean shutdown of idle TCP
   connections.

   As described in Section 2, one of the parameters in the contact
   header is the idle_close_time.  Both sides populate this field with
   the requested duration (in seconds) to maintain an open connection
   after the last non-keepalive message is transmitted over the
   connection.  The two parties SHOULD set the negotiated interval to
   the MAXIMUM value of the two requests.  If either side sets the
   interval to zero, then that side SHOULD not close idle connections.
   The other party MAY adopt this same behavior or MAY choose to close
   idle connections at its own behest.

   If no bundle data other) has been received for at least twice the
   keepalive interval, then either party MAY terminate the session by
   transmitting a one byte message type code of SHUTDOWN (as described
