Grad student: Nabeel

Notes:
	assign person for NDR (Ting)
		DCE 'XDR-like' layer
	Mike will create + begin populating 'ideas' directory
	Kevin contact somebody at UCLA regarding the /dev used
		in EmStar
		- check in timer stuff from NS2
	Mike: still don't like exceptions, but not so
		sure about the reason given last time
		- likes Capriccio? [Rob von Beren, jrvb@cs]
		http://capriccio.cs.berkeley.edu
		- Jury still out - still some 'funky' things
			(some bugs)
			valgrind / electric fense may be problem
			purify - uknown?
	Mike will e-mail out Capriccio

	Storage discussion:

		Mike + Melissa: storage manager class defn

		so we get a structure like--
		1. serialization procedure for each storable class
		2. set of lower-level storage managers [archivers]
			[store basic types interface]

		noted structure that we can use dbase functions
		for (e.g. search) functions

		StorageManager class has to implement all
			the 'high-level' functions in its
			class

		Scott: a big value of SQL db is adhoc queries

	Discussion of data movement:

		-- scheme for the overally CL<->forwarder data flow
			Melissa, Sushant, Mike

		what the object is delivered from a convergence layer
		seems like a desire to have a handle to a thing
			you can post a read on [e.g. file descriptor]
		the architectural difference here is
			'do you have it all already'?
		'push' vs 'pull' model
			current one CL pushes, then is pulled,
			then is pushed into another CL

		suggests a sort of generic send/rcv interface across
			conv layer things, storage things, and
			maybe the fragmenter thing

		so with cut-through, handling the reactive fragmentation
			re-packaging can be accomplished by the
			last guy who actually stores it

		Mike: do we Tee stuff to disk/net, then what?
		Melissa: well, yes, if you are doing CX

	Convergence layer framing issue:

		- Keith: figure out this, give a talk

		may need to make this a bit more sophisticated so
		there is distinction between a bundle and a chunk
		of another bundle being successfully moved via
		cut-through

		there might conceivably be utility in the TCP
		urgent data option here
