<h1>tca-router Routing Algorithm
</h1>

<p>
This is the implementation of the TCA bundle routing algorithm.
<p>
A TCARouter is a specialized TableBasedRouter where the route
table is manipulated in response to certain control bundles
(for example, a "register" bundle, or a "change-of-address" bundle).
Specialized routing logic is then applied in order to route late-bound
bundles addressed to a mobile node, to the mobile's current location
in the network.
<p>
The main interface point is the overridden handle_bundle_received
function which tests for the special TCA bundles (control bundles and
late-bound data bundles). For more information please see the 
<a href="configuration.html#route">route</a> command.
