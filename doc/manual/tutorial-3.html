<h1>Building a bigger DTN
</h1>

<p>
This tutorial will show you how to set up two DTN2 daemons on two separate
computers and make them talk to one another. 

<h2>Setting up the config files</h2>

<p> You'll be using server config files like the one from the
<a href="tutorial-1.html">first tutorial</a>. Follow these instructions
 on both servers, making each refer to the other one.


<h3> Routing </h3>

Find the area called Routing
configuration. Create a <a href="configuration.html#route">route</a> for each daemon like this:

<blockquote><pre>route local_eid dtn://<i>name</i>.dtn</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Name can be anything you want it to be, provided it is unique for each daemon.
e.g.  dtn://bob.dtn.  EID stands for Endpoint identifier. These are used to
identify the sender and the final destination of the bundles.

<h3>Interfaces</h3>

<p>
We need to modify the interfaces a little. An interface looks for
bundles directed to that specific daemon. It is also used for routing bundles
onwards that are not intended for that specific daemon. The <a href="configuration.html#interface">interface</a>
command has the following format: 

<blockquote>
interface add <i>name_of_interface</i> <i>type_of_interface</i>
local_addr = <i>local address</i> local_port = <i>local port number</i>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:

<blockquote><pre>interface add tcp0 tcp local_port=4556</pre></blockquote>

<p> tcp0 is merely the name of the interface. It doesn't matter what you choose
as it's just used to refer back to the interface later on. TCP is the type of
interface being used. TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol. It is the
transport layer protocol we will be using to send our bundles on. There are
other transport layer protocols we can use but for now we are going to use TCP.
The local_addr is the address of the computer. It can be an IP address or a
name. We won't be using the name as we will be using the default IP address on
the machine. Finally the (optional) local_port is the port of the
machine that the daemon will listen for incoming bundles on. The default is
4556.

<h3>Links</h3>

<p> Next we have to set up a <a href="configuration.html#link">link</a> between our computers. A link allows the
daemons to communicate to one another via the correct IP addresses and ports.
It points the bundles in the direction of the distant computer.
Go down to the link section in the conf file. Add the following:

<blockquote>
link add <i>link_name</i> <i>ip address</i>[:<i>port number</i>] ONDEMAND tcp
</blockquote>

<p>For example:

<blockquote><pre>link add link_tcp 131.12.45.192:4556 ONDEMAND tcp</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The link_name is what the link will be called and referenced to. It may be
called anything. The ip address is the IP address of the computer running the
other DTN daemon. The computer name on the network can be used, for
instance if DHCP is in use and we don't know the IP address of the machine. We
will stick with IP addresses for now. The (optional) port number should be the port
number that the other DTN daemon will listen on.

<h3>Route</h3>

<p> Lastly, add a <a href="configuration.html#route">route</a> for the end point of the daemon. This locates the
daemon on the other computer. Without it the bundles will not be sent. 

<blockquote>route add <i>name</i> <i>link_name</i></blockquote>

<p> For example:

<blockquote><pre>route add dtn://george.dtn/* link_tcp</pre></blockquote>

Don't forget to add the star. The asterisk is there to make all
bundles match this route, instead of being mistaken as administrative
bundles to be processed on the local node.

<h2>Communication: dtnsend and dtnrecv</h2>

Now you're ready to send bundles to and from daemons! Load both daemons up.
Open a terminal up and go into the dtn2/apps/dtnsend folder or find the dtnsend
executable.
<a href="man_dtnsend.html">dtnsend</a> is a DTN2 application that creates bundles and passes
them to a daemon on the local machine. It also allows you to set options for
each bundle you wish to create. The dtnsend program communicates with a DTN
daemon through port 5010 on the local machine. Note that this port number may
be changed in the configuration of the DTN daemon.

<blockquote>./dtnsend -s <i>name of sender</i> -d <i>name of destination</i>
	-t <i> type of message to be sent</i>
	-p <i>name of file being sent/message being sent</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
The -t argument can have three values (m, f, or d) for message, file, or date.

<p>
Use <a href="man_dtnsend.html">dtnsend</a> to send to one of the daemons. In this example, we'll
make bob send to george:

<blockquote><pre>./dtnsend -s dtn://bob.dtn/b -d dtn://george.dtn/g -t m -p "Hello george"</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Notice how I have added an extra part to the daemon's EID in the source and
destination parameters of the dtnsend command. The g and b are merely there to
add a path for the bundle. Without the path the receiving
daemon will interpret the bundle as an administrative bundle. The bundles will
still go to the daemon indicated by the EID. The name of the extra part to the
EID doesn't matter. It can be whatever you want it to be. Type bundle list
into bob's daemon. We should see no bundles there! Then type bundle list into
george's daemon. A bundle should be waiting there to be retrieved. 

<p>
To retrieve the bundle, use <a href="man_dtnrecv.html">dtnrecv</a>.  It collects the bundles and delivers the
message/file/date.  The dtnrecv program will wait indefinitely for new bundles
to arrive from the DTN daemon. To get out of dtnrecv hit Control-C.

<blockquote><pre>dtn2/apps/dtnrecv/dtnrecv dtn://george.dtn/g</pre></blockquote>

<p>
The message "Hello george" should be displayed. Success!
