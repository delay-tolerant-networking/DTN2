<h1>Compiling DTN2
</h1>

<p>
At the moment, DTN2 comes in source form only. Before you can install
it and start using it, you need to compile it.

<h2> On Unix </h2>

<p>
First, unpack the release:

<blockquote><pre>$ gunzip -c DTN2-2.0.2.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you want to get the latest bug fixes before they get into a
release, you'll want to get the source code from the anonymous
CVS repository instead. Please understand that you're using PRE-ALPHA
software if you use the copy from CVS. We try to keep what's in
CVS working, but it is under active development, and you might see
bugs. Before reporting them, please always use "cvs up" to get the
newest copy, then recompile and reproduce the bug.

<blockquote><pre>$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@code.dtnrg.org:/orig login
(password is "bundles")
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@code.dtnrg.org:/orig checkout DTN2
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For the time being, DTN2 releases are not happening very often, so
you'll probably be best served by using CVS to get DTN2's source
code.

<p>Next, configure DTN2:

<blockquote><pre>$ cd DTN2
$ sh configure
</pre></blockquote>



<h2> On Windows </h2>

<p>
DTN2 does not yet work as a native Windows application. It does,
however, work with the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
environment.
