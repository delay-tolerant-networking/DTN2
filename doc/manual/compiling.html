<h1>Compiling DTN2
</h1>

<p>

<h2>Compilation / Installation Instructions</h2>
<p>---------------------------------------
<p>
At the moment, DTN2 comes in source form only. Before you can install
it and start using it, you need to compile it.

<h2> On Unix </h2>

<p>
First, download DTN2 and ensure it has met all <a href="#requirements">requirements</a>. For released versions, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=101657">SourceForge DTN2 release Page</a> and unpack the release.

<blockquote><pre>$ gunzip -c DTN2-X.Y.Z.tgz | tar xvf -</pre></blockquote>

<p>For the latest ("bleeding edge") version of the code see the section on <a href="#Mercurial">Mercurial</a>
<p>Next, configure and compile DTN2: (the -C argument to configure
enables the cache which speeds up the process)

<blockquote><pre>$ cd DTN2
$ sh configure -C
$ make</pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that by default, the configure script will also run configure
inside the oasys/ subdirectory. The -C argument enables the autoconf
variable cache, which speeds up configuration. 

<p>Note that if you need to make changes to the configure.ac script or
one of the helper scripts in aclocal/*.ac, run build-configure.sh to
recreate configure and then check in both your changes as well as the
newly generated configure script.

<p>If you just want to play with DTN2 to learn how it works, you can
stop here. You can use all the programs as a regular user, with them
in the source code directories. There's no need to do a full install
into the public part of the filesystem. However, if you are deploying
DTN2, you'll want to take a look at the <tt>tools/install.sh</tt>
script. You might want to customize it, as it currently puts the files
into <tt>/usr</tt>, and some people prefer to put files in
<tt>/usr/local</tt>.

<h3>Mercurial</h3>

<p>You can also access the latest ("bleeding edge") version of the code using mercurial. The various repositories are hosted at the DTNRG SourceForge <a href="http://dtn.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/dtn/">repositories</a> and can be cloned using:
<blockquote><pre>
 % hg clone http://dtn.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/dtn/oasys
 % hg clone http://dtn.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/dtn/DTN2 
</pre></blockquote>
<p> See <a href="http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/UsingMercurial">Using Mercurial</a> for more information on using mercurial. Please be aware this code may be under frequent developmental changes, so your mileage may vary. For detailed information on using mercurial with the <a href="http://dtn.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/dtn/">SourceForge repositories</a> please see the mercurial <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mercurial#Access">access mechanisms</a>. In addition, if you grab the development copy in this way, any README files or other docs may not be quite up to date.

<p>If you plan on contributing code changes, please read the <a href="http://www.dtnrg.org/docs/code/DTN2/CONTRIBUTING">CONTRIBUTING</a> file that describes the coding conventions for the project.

<p>Please report any bugs to the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=101657&atid=630167">Bugs tracker</a>.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
---------------

<p>A good place to start for playing around with DTN is to look at the
manual and tutorials (see doc/manual/index.html). This set of
documentation explains some of the configuration and applications. If
you find omissions or errors, please feel free to post updates and
corrections to dtn-users@mailman.dtnrg.org.

<h2>Reporting Bugs / Other Help</h2>
---------------------------
<p>A <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=101657&atid=630167">bug tracking system</a> is in place. Please direct bug reports to and
direct questions to dtn-bugs@mailman.dtnrg.org.

<h3>Note - Oasys/</h3>
--------------------------
<p>Before compiling DTN2 please compile Oasys-1.3.0+ (must be 
installed or located in DTN2 or ../). For released versions, see the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=101657">SourceForge DTN2 release Page</a> and unpack the release.

<blockquote><pre>$ gunzip -c oasys-X.Y.Z.tgz | tar xvf -</pre></blockquote>

<p>For the latest ("bleeding edge") version of the code see the section on <a href="#Mercurial">Mercurial</a>
<p>Next, configure and compile oasys:

<blockquote><pre>$ cd oasys (or oasys-X.Y.Z)
$ sh configure
$ make</pre></blockquote>

<p>Support for the
following DTN2 options should be specified when configuring
oasys

<a name="BSP"/>
<h2> Installation of BSP</h2>
--------------------------
<p>The standard ciphersuites require, amongst other things, 
an implementation of sha-256 message digest algorithm.

<p>The DTN reference code uses OpenSSL for cryptographic
and related functions. Unfortunately, some versions of
OpenSSL do not include sha-256.

<p>The "configure" process checks for the availability of
sha-256 and provides an error if it is not found.

<p>If your system's OpenSSL does not have sha-256 then you 
can either upgrade it or build and use a local  version 
of OpenSSL. OpenSSL can be obtained from
<a href="http://www.openssl.org">openssl.org</a>

<p>OpenSSL 0.9.8 version include sha-256 by default. If your
system uses version 0.9.7 and you do not wish to upgrade
then you can enable sha-256 in later versions of 0.9.7,
such as 0.9.7l and 0.9.7m. To enable sha-256, specify "fips"
when running "Configure".

<p>If you wish to leave your system installation untouched and
build against a local version, then configure dtn using
<tt>./configure --with-bsp --with-openssl=<i>/path/to/openssl</i></tt>

<p>Mac OS X note: for Mac OS X users ONLY. If you build dtn
against a local OpenSSL using "--with-openssl=/path/to/openssl"
you MUST also specify with it LDFLAGS="-Wl,-search_paths_first". 
The configuration for OS X users would then be 
<tt>./configure --with-bsp --with-openssl=<i>/path/to/openssl LDFL</i></tt>
<p>

<h2> Installation of norm</h2>
--------------------------
<p>Please see the norm <a href="cl-norm.html#install_norm">installation</a> instructions.

<h2> On Windows </h2>

<p>
DTN2 does not yet work as a native Windows application. It might,
however, work with the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
environment.

<h3> Install Cygwin </h3>

<p>
The first step is to install Cygwin on your computer. The best way to
do this is to download <a
href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">setup.exe</a> from their website.
We suggest storing it on your computer in a new directory you make
named <tt>c:\cygwin\download</tt>.

<p>
Start <tt>setup.exe</tt> and choose "Install from Internet". (Always
think carefully before running an executeable you downloaded from
the Internet, even if a nice manual like this told you to do it!
Is your virus checker running? Is it up to date? Did the file come from the
website you think it did?)
Use the default root directory, <tt>c:\cygwin</tt>.
Make the "Local Package Directory" <tt>c:\cygwin\download</tt>. Cygwin
will ask you to choose a mirror, so choose one that is close to you on the
Internet. It will then ask you to "Select Packages". The defaults here
are pretty good, but you need to make a few changes:

<ul>
<li> Open Database and ensure that <b>db4.3</b>, <b>libdb4.3</b>
and <b>libdb4.3-devel</b> are selected for installation.
<li> Open Editors and ensure an editor you like and know how to use is
selected.
<li> Open Libs, and check that the <b>tcltk</b>
and <b>sunrpc</b> packages will be installed.
</ul>

<p>
Continue with the installation. When it is done, you'll have a working
Cygwin installation and be ready to proceed. If you are asked to
reboot, please do so. This ensures the correct version of Cygwin will be
used.

<h3> Compile using Cygwin </h3>

<p> Once you have installed Cygwin, you'll have a new item in your
Start -&gt; All Programs menu called Cygwin, and inside that, one
called Bash.  When you select it, you get a <tt>bash</tt> shell, which
is like a <tt>CMD</tt> window, only cooler. You start out in your
home directory, which in Cygwin is <tt>/home/$user</tt>, but in
Windows, it is <tt>c:\cygwin\home\$user</tt>. Now that you have a
Unix-like window, follow the Unix instructions above. Cygwin comes
with CVS, so you can even use CVS to fetch the source code, as
described above.
