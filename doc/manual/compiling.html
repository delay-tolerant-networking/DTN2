<h1>Compiling DTN2
</h1>

<p>
At the moment, DTN2 comes in source form only. Before you can install
it and start using it, you need to compile it.

<h2> On Unix </h2>

<p>
First, unpack the release:

<blockquote><pre>$ gunzip -c DTN2-2.0.2.tgz | tar xvf -
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
If you want to get the latest bug fixes before they get into a
release, you'll want to get the source code from the anonymous
CVS repository instead. Please understand that you're using PRE-ALPHA
software if you use the copy from CVS. We try to keep what's in
CVS working, but it is under active development, and you might see
bugs. Before reporting them, please always use "cvs up" to get the
newest copy, then recompile and reproduce the bug.

<blockquote><pre>$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@code.dtnrg.org:/orig login
(password is "bundles")
$ cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@code.dtnrg.org:/orig checkout DTN2
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
For the time being, DTN2 releases are not happening very often, so
you'll probably be best served by using CVS to get DTN2's source
code.

<p>Next, configure DTN2:

<blockquote><pre>$ cd DTN2
$ sh configure
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Finally, compile the software:

<blockquote><pre>$ make
</pre></blockquote>

<p>If you just want to play with DTN2 to learn how it works, you can
stop here. You can use all the programs as a regular user, with them
in the source code directories. There's no need to do a full install
into the public part of the filesystem. However, if you are deploying
DTN2, you'll want to take a look at the <tt>tools/install.sh</tt>
script. You might want to customize it, as it currently puts the files
into <tt>/usr</tt>, and some people prefer to put files in
<tt>/usr/local</tt>.

<h2> On Windows </h2>

<p>
DTN2 does not yet work as a native Windows application. It does,
however, work with the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin</a>
environment.

<h3> Install Cygwin </h3>

<p>
The first step is to install Cygwin on your computer. The best way to
do this is to download <a
href="http://cygwin.com/setup.exe">setup.exe</a> from their website.
We suggest storing it on your computer in a new directory you make
named <tt>c:\cygwin\download</tt>.

<p>
Start <tt>setup.exe</tt> and choose "Install from Internet". Use the
default root directory, <tt>c:\cygwin</tt>.
Make the "Local Package Directory" <tt>c:\cygwin\download</tt>. Cygwin
will ask you to choose a mirror, so choose one close to you on the
Internet. It will then ask you to "Select Packages". The defaults here
are pretty good, but you need to make a few changes:

<ul>
<li> Open Database and ensure that <b>db4.2</b>, <b>libdb4.2</b>
and <b>libdb4.2-devel</b> are selected for installation.
<li> Open Editors and ensure an editor you like and know how to use is
selected.
<li> Open Libs, and select the <b>sunrpc</b> package for installation.
<li> While in Libs, check that the <b>tcltk</b> package will be installed.
</ul>

<p>
Continue with the installation. When it is done, you'll have a working
Cygwin installation and be ready to proceed.

<h3> Compile using Cygwin </h3>

<p> Once you have installed Cygwin, you'll have a new item in your
Start -&gt; All Programs menu called Cygwin, and inside that, one
called Bash.  When you select it, you get a <tt>bash</tt> shell, which
is like a <tt>CMD</tt> window, only cooler. You start out in your
home directory, which in Cygwin is <tt>/home/$user</tt>, but in
Windows, it is <tt>c:\cygwin\home\$user</tt>. Now that you have a
Unix-like window, follow the Unix instructions above. Cygwin comes
with CVS, so you can even use CVS to fetch the source code, as
described above.
