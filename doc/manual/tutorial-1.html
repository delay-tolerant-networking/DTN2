<h1>Starting dtnd and sending a ping
</h1>

<p>
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to configure and start an instance
of dtnd, then make it answer a ping.

<h2> Configuration </h2>

<p>
In this section, we'll prepare an appropriate <tt>dtn.conf</tt>
file for our instance of dtnd.

<h3> Directories </h3>

<p>
First, you need to choose a directory that will hold the files dtnd
needs. For the purposes of this tutorial, we'll assume your username
is <tt>fred</tt> and that you want dtnd to write into
<tt>/home/fred/dtn</tt>.

<p> Make the <tt>/home/fred/dtn</tt> directory, then copy the example
<tt>dtn.conf</tt> file from <tt>DTN2/daemon/dtn.conf</tt> to
<tt>/home/fred/dtn/dtn.conf</tt>. Edit the <tt>dtn.conf</tt> file. For
this tutorial, we'll use the simplest database to configure,
BerkeleyDB. Leave the <i>storage set type berkeleydb</i> line alone.
Set the <i>payloaddir</i> to <tt>/home/fred/dtn/bundles</tt> and set
the <i>dbdir</i> to <tt>/home/fred/dtn/db</tt>.

<p> The <i>dbdir</i> directory is where persistent objects that DTN2 uses to
manage its internal state live. This database will remain fairly small. It
needs to be preserved between invocations of the DTN2 daemon, because
the data in it lets DTN2 know the status of registrations with
clients, and bundles which are in flight in the network. One of the
"disruptions" that a DTN is tolerant of is the failure of a node.
Using the data in the database, a new DTN2 daemon can carry on the
work the previous one was doing. But note that if the contents of the
database are lost, it is as if this node never existed, and there will
be repercussions in the DTN (like retransmissions of bundles) as a
result.

<p> The <i>payload</i> directory is where bundles which are in-flight
live. In general, the bundles in this directory are ones which this
DTN2 instance has custody of. That means that if they disappear out of
this directory, they will be lost forever, since there are no other
authoritative copies of the bundle in the network. DTN2 and the DTN
protocols are designed to maintain the files in this directory without
leaving old ones lying around. If you see an old file there, it's
likely due to a bug. Please help us get to the bottom of what's causing it.
Unlike packets, which are typically quite small (from 50 to 64,000
bytes), a single bundle can be very large (over 2 gigabytes).
On a server dedicated to
running DTN2, your payload directory should have access to the largest
partition on your server. As an analogy, on a mail server the mail
spool is usually on /var, and has access to the majority of the extra
disk space on a machine. The same should be true for the payload
directory.

<h3>Using TCL in the Config File</h3>

<p> You don't need to make any changes in the <i>local_eid</i>, but
scroll down and take a look at it anyway. In the defualt
configuration, it looks like this: <i>route local_eid
"dtn://[info hostname].dtn"</i>. Note the square
brackets. To understand what's happening here, you need to know that
this configuration file is not simply a file of settings for dtnd, but
an actual <a href="http://www.tcl.tk">TCL</a> script. It is interpreted by
the TCL interpreter that is built in to dtnd. In TCL, square brackets
mean "interpret this first, and replace the brackets with the result".
So before dtnd sees a <i>route local_eid ...</i> command, TCL
processes the <i>info hostname</i> command. As you might be able to
guess by now, the entire line results in the <i>local_eid</i> being
set to a custom string based on your hostname.

<p> This is the only place in this particular configuration file where
we will use TCL features like the square brackets. However, you should
remember that all the power of TCL is available to you as you write
your own configuration files, should you desire it. For an example of
this, see <a href="configuration.html#rotate">the example showing how
to rotate logs</a> from within dtnd.

<p> So the local EID is set, but what is it? From the
<a href="arch.html">Architecture</a> section, you should recall
that nodes in the DTN are identified by EIDs. The local EID
is simply the way our DTN node will refer to itself. Without this
setting, it would not recognize bundles intended for it, and might
just pass them on ad infinitum! People who have configured Internet
email systems like Postfix or Sendmail might recognize this setting,
as mail routers need to know their own name for the same reason.

<p>
And EID is a string that is used throughout the DTN to identify
an endpoint. That leaves you considerable latitude on how to set
it. We recommend for now that you set it according to the
machine name where the DTN node is running, as the example does.

<p>
At this time, one dtnd can have only one local EID. This
limitation might disappear in future versions if it proves to be a
problem.

<h3> Interfaces </h3>

<p>
Take a look at the <i>interface add</i> commands a few lines
down. The command <i>interface add tcp0 tcp</i> adds a
TCP convergence layer named <i>tcp0</i> to the server. This
means that the daemon will start listening on port 4556 for incoming
connections from other servers in the DTN.

<p>Usually DTN nodes that are communicating via
TCP listen on port 4556, based on the IANA port assignment.
If you have another application on the same server listening on
port 4556, you'll need to choose a different port for your dtnd
to use. 

<p> The <i>interface add</i> command can take convergence layer
specific arguments to customize the behavior of the interface.
For the purposes of this tutorial,
we will be using the defaults. For more information on these arguments
see the reference pages on the <a href="configuration.html#cls">various
convergence layers</a>.

<p> In some security contexts, and with some virtual interface
configurations, it is desirable to have dtnd listen only on a certain
interface, for instance "listen to internal connections only".
You can do this by adding <i>local_addr=desired-ip</i> to the end of
the <i>interface add</i> command. The default <i>local_addr</i>
is 0.0.0.0, meaning "listen on all interfaces".
For this tutorial, we will allow dtnd to listen on all
interfaces, so leave the <i>interface add</i> command as it is.

<p> Note that we are adding an interface of type TCP. There are other
ways that DTN nodes can communicate, including via UDP, raw
ethernet frames, and across a filesystem
(where some external activity, like a messenger with a USB keychain
drive, is responsible for moving the files). A server that is
using multiple convergence layers
has other <i>interface add</i> lines in the configuration file.

<p>
In fact, below the <i>interface add</i> line for the TCP convergence
layer is one for the UDP covergence layer. Because we are setting up
a standalone server in this tutorial, neither <i>udp0</i> nor
<i>tcp0</i> will end up getting used to move bundles at this point.

<h3> Links and Routes </h3>

<p>
Because in this tutorial, we are setting up a standalone dtnd,
we will not need any <tt>link</tt> or <tt>route</tt> statements.
You'll end up with a Disruption Tolerant Network made up of
only one daemon. Not much to brag about, but out of simple
beginnings come great things!

<h2> Initializing the Database </h2>

<p>
Before dtnd can use the database to keep track of runtime state,
it needs to initialize it. This is a simple matter of starting
the daemon once with the <tt>--init-db</tt> argument. You'll
also want to give it the location of the configuration file, so
that dtnd can find the correct database directory. Put that together
and you have:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>daemon/dtnd -c /home/fred/dtn/dtn.conf --init-db </font>
[1178218919.248562 /dtnd notice] random seed is 248552
[1178218919.248660 /dtnd notice] DTN daemon starting up... (pid 3268)
[1178218919.263195 /dtnd notice] initializing persistent data store
[1178218919.263343 /dtn/storage notice] creating new database directory /var/tmp/dtn/db
[1178218921.130742 /dtnd notice] closing persistent data store
</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2> Running the Daemon </h2>

<p>
For now, you start dtnd from the commandline, like any other
Unix command. By default, the TCL interpreter takes input from
standard in, so you will need to leave it running in the foreground. While
you are learning the ins and outs of dtnd, it is best to run it
this way, so that you can interact with it. Use the <tt>-c</tt>
argument to tell it where to find the configuration file.
For information on other arguments you can give dtnd, see
the <a href="man/dtnd.html">dtnd man page</a>.

<p>
Once you start dtnd with a command like <tt>DTN2/daemon/dtnd -c
/home/fred/dtn/dtn.conf</tt>, it will put out some messages, then
give you the <tt>dtn%</tt> prompt. This means the server is up
and running, awaiting commands from you. Things you type at the
prompt are interpreted by the same TCL interpreter that just parsed
the configuration file. In a way, you can consider the configuration
file a list of commands that will be issued for you
each time you start the server.

<p>
Here's an example of starting up the server:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>daemon/dtnd -c /home/fred/dtn/dtn.conf</font>
[1178218965.919630 /dtnd notice] random seed is 919621
[1178218965.919725 /dtnd notice] DTN daemon starting up... (pid 3271)
[1178218965.943359 /dtn/bundle/daemon notice] loading bundles from data store
zabar dtn% 
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You get a bit more info if you start up with the '-l info argument':

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>daemon/dtnd -c /home/fred/dtn/dtn.conf -l info</font>
[1178219015.034268 /dtnd notice] random seed is 34259
[1178219015.034621 /dtnd notice] DTN daemon starting up... (pid 3272)

</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Use the online help system to learn what you can do from here. Type
<b>help</b>. For help on a specific command, type <b>help
<i>command</i></b>. For now, though, you don't need to use any
commands. Just let dtnd run in its own window. When we start talking
to dtnd with an application you'll see log messages in the window
where dtnd is running.

<h2> Pinging the daemon </h2>

<p>
A Disruption Tolerant Network is made up of a number of
servers whose job is to move bundles through the system.
But where do the bundles come from? They come from applications.
In the future, you can expect to see applications to move
scientific data, web pages, e-mail, and other data that
needs to traverse a network region prone to disruption.
For now though, the best way to see your new DTN (consisting
of just your one server) operate is to send a ping bundle into
to it, and see what comes back out!

<p>
To ping your server, run the <tt>dtnping</tt> command. It lives
in the <tt>DTN2/apps/dtnping</tt> directory. You'll need to give it
one argument, which is the EID address of the endpoint that you
want to ping. Since there is only one server in your DTN, the
choice should be simple. You need to use the local EID
that you set in the configuration file. If you'd like to
check what dtnd thinks it's local EID name is, use the
<tt>registration list</tt> command in the window where dtnd is running.
The first registration is always the server registering it's own
EID with itself, so that it can handle administrative bundles, like
the ping bundle we are about to send.

<p>
Alternatively, <tt>dtnping</tt> contains a convenience shortcut
whereby the string 'localhost' is interpreted as the local EID
of the daemon.

<p>
Here's an example of how to ping a server who's local EID
is <i>dtn://dtn-a.dtn</i>:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>./dtnping localhost</font>
source_eid [dtn://zabar.research.intel-research.net.dtn/ping.3310]
dtn_register succeeded, regid 10
PING [dtn://zabar.research.intel-research.net.dtn/ping]...
20 bytes from [dtn://zabar.research.intel-research.net.dtn/ping]: 'dtnping!' seqno=0, time=212 ms
20 bytes from [dtn://zabar.research.intel-research.net.dtn/ping]: 'dtnping!' seqno=1, time=297 ms
<font color=blue>Ctrl-C</font></pre></blockquote>

<h2> What next? </h2>

<p>
You've set up a standalone dtnd and pinged it. From here, you
can explore two directions. In the <a href="tutorial-2.html">
DTN2 applications</a> tutorial, you can learn how to use the other
applications that come with DTN2 to interact with your new little
DTN. In the <a href="tutorial-3.html">building a bigger DTN</a>
tutorial, you can see how to use links to make several nodes work
together as part of a bigger DTN.
