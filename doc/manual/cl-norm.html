<h1>NORM Convergence Layer
</h1>

<p>
A Nack-Oriented Reliable Multicast (NORM) convergence layer. The <a href="http://cs.itd.nrl.navy.mil/work/norm/index.php">NORM</a> protocol is designed to provide end-to-end reliable transport of bulk data objects or streams over generic IP multicast routing and forwarding services. NORM uses a selective, negative acknowledgement (NACK) mechanism for transport reliability and offers additional protocol mechanisms to conduct reliable multicast sessions with limited "a priori" coordination among senders and receivers. A congestion control scheme is specified to allow the NORM protocol fairly share available network bandwidth with other transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). 
<p>It is capable of operating with both reciprocal multicast routing among senders and receivers and with asymmetric connectivity (possibly a unicast return path) from the senders to receivers. The protocol offers a number of features to allow different types of applications or possibly other higher level transport protocols to utilize its service in different ways. The protocol leverages the use of FEC-based repair and other IETF reliable multicast transport (RMT) building blocks in its design. Norm sessions persist across link down/up events in order to take full advantage of the built-up tx cache used to satisfy repair requests.

<h2><p>Common Configurations
<p>---------------------</h2>

<p>Here are some basic examples to get you started.  The full list of link:w

parameters are summarized in the next section.

<p>Assume DTN nodes A, B, and C can communicate over an IP network.
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>EID
<th>IPv4 Address

<tr>
<td><tt>dtn://node_a</tt>
<td>10.1.101.1

<tr>
<td><tt>dtn://node_b</tt>
<td>10.1.102.1

<tr>
<td><tt>dtn://node_c</tt>
<td>10.1.103.1

<tr>
<td><tt>dtn://node_d</tt>
<td>10.1.104.1
</table>
<h4>Point-to-point link A <-> B</h4>

<p>Below are the "link add" directives for an always-on unicast link between
nodes A and B.  Congestion control is enabled (cc) with a maximum tx rate
of 230Kbps.  "ack" places the remote node in the acking_list; positive
acknowledgment is expected after zero of more nack-based repair cycles.
"ack" may reduce the number of flush messages.
<p>
<p><i> Node A configuration</i>
    <p><tt>link add link_to_b 10.1.102.1:4557 ALWAYSON norm remote_eid=dtn://node_b cc ack rate=230000</tt>
<p><i> Node B configuration</i>
   <p><tt> link add link_to_a 10.1.101.1:4557 ALWAYSON norm remote_eid=dtn://node_a cc ack rate=230000</tt>

<h4>One-to-many multicast A -> B,C,D</h4>

<p>For a one-to-many multicast link, use "link add" on the node sourcing data and
use "interface add" on the sink nodes.  The Node A "acking_list" requests postive
acknowledgments from Nodes B and C (after zero or more nack-based repair
cycles).  Delivery to Node D may not succeeed because it's not in the acking_list.
"nodeid" might be needed for senders and/or receivers when nodes are multi-homed.
<p>
<p><i> Node A configuration</i>
    <p><tt>link add link_to_bc 239.255.0.1:4558 ALWAYSON norm multicast_interface=eth0 remote_eid=dtn://group 
cc rate=230000 acking_list=10.1.102.1,10.1.103.1</tt>
<p><i> Node B configuration</i>
   <p><tt> interface add norm0 norm multicast_interface=eth0 group_addr=239.255.0.1 nodeid=10.1.102.1</tt>
<p><i> Node C configuration</i>
   i<p><tt> interface add norm0 norm multicast_interface=eth0 group_addr=239.255.0.1 nodeid=10.1.103.1</tt>
<p><i> Node D configuration</i>
   <p><tt> interface add norm0 norm multicast_interface=eth0 group_addr=239.255.0.1 nodeid=10.1.104.1</tt>

<h4>Many-to-many</h4>

<p>For a many-to-many multicast link, use "link add" on all the nodes sourcing data.
Below, all nodes can send to and receive from the multicast group.  Note the
acking_list is adjusted accordingly in each directive.
<p>
<p><i> Node A configuration</i>
   <p><tt> link add link_to_bc 239.255.0.1:4558 ALWAYSON norm multicast_interface=eth0 remote_eid=dtn://group 
cc rate=230000 acking_list=10.1.102.1,10.1.103.1,10.1.104.1</tt>
<p><i> Node B configuration</i>
   <p><tt> link add link_to_bc 239.255.0.1:4558 ALWAYSON norm multicast_interface=eth0 remote_eid=dtn://group 
cc rate=230000 acking_list=10.1.101.1,10.1.103.1,10.1.104.1</tt>
<p><i> Node C configuration</i>
   <p><tt> link add link_to_bc 239.255.0.1:4558 ALWAYSON norm multicast_interface=eth0 remote_eid=dtn://group 
cc rate=230000 acking_list=10.1.101.1,10.1.102.1,10.1.104.1</tt>
<p><i> Node D configuration</i>
    <p><tt> link add link_to_bc 239.255.0.1:4558 ALWAYSON norm multicast_interface=eth0 remote_eid=dtn://group 
cc rate=230000 acking_list=10.1.101.1,10.1.102.1,10.1.103.1</tt>

<td> The number of flush messages sent at the end of each transmission.
Flush messages are used to prompt receivers to request needed repairs.

<td>number (objects)
<td>0
<td>Partition large DTN bundles into multiple NORM data objects for
transmission. With the default of zero bytes, no object partitioning
is performed. Setting object size to a relatively small value, e.g.
50000 bytes, may be useful in some contention based networks (see
tx_spacer). This feature is similar in concept to proactive bundle
fragmentation or "bundle MTU" (neither yet implemented in DTN2).
(see tx_spacer). 

<tr>
<td><tt>tx_spacer</tt>
<td>number (ms)
<td>0
<td> When combined with object_size, tx_spacer may be used to add a 
constant pause time (ms) between successive NORM data object 
transmissions. On contention based networks, this pause time may 
give other nodes a chance to transmit.

<tr>
<td><tt>keepalive_intvl</tt>
<td>number (ms)
<td>5000
<td>For DTN opportunistic links, keepalive_intvl is the number of
miliseconds between successive keepalive packets. Opportunistic

missed. In addition, reliable mode links send watermarks at
keepalive intervals.

<tr>
<td><tt>group_size</tt>
<td>number 
<td>1000
<td> Group size is advertised to the receiver group where it is used in 
calculating backoff timers. Due to encoding techniques in the NORM 
header, 1000 receivers is the smallest value allowed by the NORM 
protocol.

<td>number (bytes)
<td>20971520
<td> Size of the NORM object cache per link.

<tr>
