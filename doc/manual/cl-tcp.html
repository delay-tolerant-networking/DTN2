<h1>TCP Convergence Layer
</h1>

<p>
The TCP Convergence Layer connects DTN nodes via a TCP channel.
As with all TCP connections, it is reliable (meaning the underlying
layers attempt to deliver all the data sent, in the order it was
sent). In the context of a DTN, however, a TCP connection is only
reliable while it is up. The DTN components (each endpoint of the
TCP connection) are ready and willing to invoke various types of
recovery mechanisms if the transfer of a bundle is interrupted
by a broken TCP connection.

<p>
The TCP session between two DTN nodes only moves bundles in one
direction. The TCP session itself is two directional, so that
the TCP convergence layer on the bundle receiver can send feedback
to the sender. In a case where bundles need to move both directions
between two nodes, there will be two TCP connections, each one
initiated by one of the sides. The side that initiates the connection
sends bundles over it.

<h2> Interfaces and Links  </h2>

<p> Each TCP link needs to be configured on both sides. On one side,
it is configured as a passive listener (called an <b>interface</b>
by dtnd), and on the other side as an active session initiator (called
a <b>link</b>). But take note of the <tt>receiver_connect</tt> option,
which reverses things.

<h3>Passive Listener</h3>

<p> The <tt>interface add</tt> command creates the passive
listener side of the session. It always takes at least one argument,
which is the local address. This is specified with either the IP or
Host address families.  For more information about address families,
see the <a href="configuration.html#interface">interface add</a>
documentation. After the local address, you may include optional arguments
which are detailed below.

<h3> Active Initiator</h3>

<p> The <tt>link add</tt> command creates an object in the system that
is capable of initiating a connection outbound to other DTN nodes.
Depending on the state of the link, as managed by the various options
to the <tt>link</tt> command, it may or may not actually be actively
opening or maintaining a TCP connection at a given time.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>These options can appear after the <tt>link add</tt> command,
or after the <tt>interface add</tt> command.

<table>

<tr><th>Name<th>Type<th>Default<th>Comment

<tr>
<td>bundle_ack_enabled<td>boolean<td>true
<td>Should we send an ACK when we have received the entire bundle?

<tr>
<td>idle_close_time<td>integer seconds<td>30
<td>Number of seconds after which to close the connection if no data
other than keepalives arrives.

<tr>
<td>keepalive_interval<td>integer seconds<td>2
<td>The number of seconds between keepalives requested for
both directions on this link. The actual value of this parameter
for a connection will be decided during
<a href="#negotiation">parameter negotiation</a>.

<tr>
<td>local_addr<td>IP address or a DNS hostname<td>0.0.0.0
(interface), -1 (link)
<td>In the case of an interface, this is the IP address that the
server will listen on. In the case of a link, the default
ensures that the operating system choses the appropriate source
address for the connection before it is initiated.

<tr>
<td>local_port<td>IP port number<td>4556 (interface), 0 (link)
<td>In the case of an interface, this is the TCP port that the
server will listen on. In the case of a link, changing this
setting from the default of 0 instructs the operating system to
use the given port. In general, it is better to allow the OS to
choose the source port itself.

<tr>
<td>partial_ack_len<td>integer bytes<td>1024
<td>If dtnd has read at least this much data without sending an
acknowledgement, send one.

<tr>
<td>reactive_frag_enabled<td>boolean<td>true
<td>If the servers loses the connection while sending, should it
fragment the bundle so that when the connection is working again
the it can start sending from the last ack, instead of from the
beginning?

<tr>
<td>readbuf_len<td>integer bytes<td>32768
<td>The maximum number of bytes to read from the network
before flushing them to the local copy of the bundle.
Recall that the local copy of the bundle might be in
memory, and not on disk. See <a href="configuration.html#param">
<tt>param set payload_mem_threshold</tt></a> command.

<tr>
<td>receiver_connect<td>boolean<td>false
<td>This option reverses the direction of dataflow, making the
initiator receive bundles. (Not yet implemented.)

<tr>
<td>data_timeout<td>integer miliseconds<td>5000 (5 seconds)
<td>Number of milliseconds to wait for an expected
response from the other side. 

<tr>
<td>test_fragment_size<td>integer bytes<td>-1 (disabled)
<td>Artifically close the connection, simulating a link failure,
after this many bytes. This feature is probably only useful while
testing the fragmentation system. (No longer implemented.)

<tr>
<td>writebuf_len<td>integer bytes<td>32768
<td>The maximum number of bytes to read from the on-disk bundle
at a time for buffering before it is sent across the connection.

<h3> Parameter Negotiation </h3>

<p>
Some parameters take effect solely inside one daemon or the other.
Other paramaters are sent across the link at the beginning during
a negotiation phase. The following table summarizes which parameters are
subject to negotiation, and how the negotiation works.

<p>
<table>
<tr><th>Name<th>Negotiation
<tr><td>partial_ack_len<td>Minimum of near side and far side.
<tr><td>keepalive_interval<td>Minimum of near side and far side.
<tr><td>idle_close_time<td>Minimum of near side and far side.
<tr><td>bundle_ack_enabled<td>Logical AND of near and far side.
<tr><td>reactive_frag_enabled<td>Logical AND of near and far side.
<tr><td>receiver_connect_<td>Logical OR of near and far side.
