The best way to get involved with the manual is to choose a piece that
is not done. Claim it to make sure no one else is duplicating the
effort by sending a note to the mailing list. When you have a
completed file, or a patch to an existing file, send it to the list so
that Alex or someone else can check it in for you.

Here's a todo list of things you could choose to do. It is in order
from easy and immediate to harder and longer term:
<ul>
<li> Add a list of subsections to the table of contents for
at least Configuration.
<li> Update manual.css to make things more readable, and to make
the HTML easier to write. Most pressing need is &lt;pre&gt; tag
improvements. 
<li> write more tutorials. One that shows how to make a link between two
dtnd's is the next required one. After that, a debugging one would be
good. Also we need one showing a different storage backend.
<li> write the arch.html page, which will draw heavily on Mike's (and
other people's) paper.
<li> document one of the commands for the main reference page. You
usually need to read the source to know exactly how things work. This
is critical, because some things do not work like you expect
from their names... typically this a bug, and you can ask someone to
fix it, or document it as-is, if it will take several releases to get a
complete fix done.
<li> Write more manpages. As of now, only two are done. (When you do
dtnd.8, beware that you'll need to edit the Makefiles a bit, since
they currently assume all manpages are in section 1.)
<li> Choose the best tool to turn man pages into HTML and arrange
for it to run when you run make.
<li> choose a documentation markup system (like docbook) and setup a
system to generate .html, .pdf, etc from it. Convert everything that's
done so far into the new system and write a document for manual
writers who come behind you explaining what you did. This is not a
required project, but it might be nice to do. The sooner we do it, the
less work the conversion step will be. But it could never happen and
no harm would come from it.
</ul>

<p>
Another far-out wishlist item is to make anonymous comments on the
bottom of the online version of the manual possible. The effect of the
comments on the bottom of the mySQL online manual is to make it
much much better, both by letting readers point out gotchas they
suffered, and by letting different voices be heard. Getting this
done will involve getting buy-in from Melissa (webmistress
extraordinare). The system should also run in a mode where a
maintainer can nuke comments that are no longer needed when their
content has been rolled into the manual.

Find a place to document useful TCL debugging tricks. For example:

<pre>proc bl {} { puts [ bundle list ]; after 5000 bl }</pre>
