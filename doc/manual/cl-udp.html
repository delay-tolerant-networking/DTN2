<h1>UDP Convergence Layer
</h1>

<p>
The UDP Convergence Layer connects DTN nodes via a UDP channel.
A UDP channel is unreliable, but the the DTN protocols overcome
this and attempt to achieve reliable delivery of bundles
over the unreliable UDP channel.

<p>
A UDP datagram is limited in size to 65536 bytes. The UDP convergence
layer adds a header of 24 bytes to every datagram.
Because bundles are sent inside of a single UDP datagram, that
means that bundles which exceed Y bytes cannot be
transmitted or received with the UDP convergence layer.

<p>
Because the underlying datalink protocol (often Ethernet) rarely
supports the full size of the maximum UDP datagram, is will be broken
into fragments and reassembled at the far end. This process, like the
UDP protocol itself, has no provisions for retransmissions. As a
result, over a sufficiently lossy link UDP datgrams large enough
to trigger IP fragmentation may end up with a successful transmission
rate of 0. As a result, the practical upper limit for the size of bundles
sent via the UDP Convergence Layer is nearer to 2 to 3 times the
Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the underlying medium. For
Ethernet, the MTU is 1500 bytes.

<h2> Interfaces and Links  </h2>

<p> Each UDP link needs to be configured on both sides. On one side,
it is configured as a passive listener (called an <b>interface</b>
by dtnd), and on the other side as an active session initiator (called
a <b>link</b>).

<h3>Passive Listener</h3>

<p> The <tt>interface add</tt> command creates the passive
listener side of the session. 

<h3> Active Initiator</h3>

<p> The <tt>link add</tt> command creates an object in the system that
is capable of sending bundles outbound to other DTN nodes.
Depending on the state of the link, as managed by the various options
to the <tt>link</tt> command, it may or may not actually be 
in use to forward bundles at a given time.

<h2>Options</h2>

<p>These options can appear after the <tt>link add</tt> command,
or after the <tt>interface add</tt> command.

<tr><th>Name<th>Type<th>Default<th>Comment

<tr>
<td>local_addr<td>IP address or a DNS hostname<td>0.0.0.0
(interface), -1 (link)
<td>In the case of an interface, this is the IP address that the
server will listen on. In the case of a link, the default
ensures that the operating system choses the appropriate source
address for the connection before it is initiated.

<tr>
<td>local_port<td>IP port number<td>5000 (interface), 0 (link)
<td>In the case of an interface, this is the TCP port that the
server will listen on. In the case of a link, changing this
setting from the default of 0 instructs the operating system to
use the given port. In general, it is better to allow the OS to
choose the source port itself.

<tr>
<td>remote_addr<td>IP address or a DNS hostname<td><i>No default.</i>
<td>The IP address to which this link will send datagrams.

<tr>
<td>remote_port<td>IP port number<td><i>No default.</i>
<td>The UDP port to which this link will send datagrams.
