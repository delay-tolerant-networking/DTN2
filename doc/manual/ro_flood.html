<h1>Flood Router
</h1>

<p>
This is the implementation of a flooding based bundle router.

<p>
In the implementation an internal BundleList is maintaned in which 
all bundles are kept until their expiration time. This prevents 
the main daemon logic from opportunistically deleting bundles when 
they've been transmitted.

<p>
Whenever a new link arrives, we add a wildcard route to the table.
Then when a bundle arrives, we can stick it on the all_bundles list
and just call the base class route_bundle function. The core base
class logic then makes sure that a copy of the bundle is forwarded
exactly once to each neighbor.For more information please see the 
<a href="configuration.html#route">route</a> command.

<p>
Note: At present this will forward a bundle back to the node from 
which it arrived.
