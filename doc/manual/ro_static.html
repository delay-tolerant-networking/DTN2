<h1>Static Routing Protocol
</h1>

<p>
This is the implementation of the basic bundle routing algorithm
that only does static routing. Routes can be parsed from a
configuration file or injected via the command line and/or
management interfaces.

As a result, the class simply uses the default event handlers from
the table based router implementation. For more information please see 
the <a href="configuration.html#route">route</a> command.
