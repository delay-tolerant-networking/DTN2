<h1>Style Guide
</h1>

<h2> Writing </h2>

<p>
Write the kind of documentation that you would like to read.
Our role models are old Unix man pages and the MySQL online HTML
pages (with user comments!).
Our anti-role-models are Windows help pages: "To start a new file,
choose File -&gt; New".

<p>
Know your audience. Be chatty and explain concepts in a tutorial
page. In a reference page be above all precise, then concise, and
finally if possible be interesting to read (but this is a distant third).
For every setting where it makes sense (and it almost always does)
be crystal clear about what the default is. Offer guidance on
what the best practices are and why.

<p>
Be honest about limits, shortcomings, misbehavior and the like.
When it makes sense, document internal things (include a disclaimer
that this is something internal, and if you count on it not changing
you'll probably be surprised.)
We have no secrets to hide, we have no marketing department to
keep happy.

<p>
Read more than you write. While warming up to bang out a new
section of the manual, proofread a page and look for ways the code
has changed from when the page was written.
You should almost always find yourself reading code in order
to write the docs about it. For some of this code, writing the
documentation on it is the closest to careful QA it will ever get.
Don't pass up this chance to kill a few bugs.

<h2> HTML Stuff </h2>

<ul>
<li> Use the template.html file to start a new file.

<li> If you refer to a file that does not exist yet with an href,
make it exist as a stub using the content in the template.html file.
This will hopefully encourage people who stumble across it to help us.

<li> Try for high quality HTML, but don't kill yourself to be
XHTML 9.x (or whatever the newest annoying thing is from W3C).

<li> Use CSS sparingly to improve readability and simplify the HTML
code. I'd be surprised/unhappy if we ended up with more then 20
styles.

<li> Our targeted web browsers are w3m and Firefox. Realistically,
every other browser is between these two in capabilities. (w3m is like
Lynx, but can do tables.)

<li> Usage of &lt;tt&gt;, &lt;b&gt;, and &lt;i&gt; is not very
well standardized yet. tt is usually for verbatim output or input.
i is usually for a variable representing user input.

<li> There's no excuse for these pages to be too big to download
at 9600 baud from the middle of Africa. Trim fat if doing so does not
hurt the final product.

</ul>
