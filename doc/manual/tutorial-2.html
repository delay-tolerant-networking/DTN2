<h1>DTN2 Applications
</h1>

<p>
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the programs in
the <tt>apps</tt> directory to send data of various kinds
through your DTN. You'll get to see more things happening if you've
followed the instructions in <a href="tutorial-3.html">
Building a Bigger DTN</a> first, but even with a standalone
dtnd, you can send and receive bundles.

<h2> dtnsend and dtnrecv </h2>

<p>
The most basic tools to send bundles through the DTN network
are <tt>dtnsend</tt> and <tt>dtnrecv</tt>. You can use
<tt>dtnsend</tt> to create a bundle and set various options
in it. The bundle will move through the DTN until it gets
to the destination node. You'll then use <tt>dtnrecv</tt>
to retrieve the bundle out of the final dtnd.

<p>
First, take a look at the options <tt>dtnsend</tt> takes:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtnsend/dtnsend -h</font>
usage: dtnsend [opts] -s &lt;source_eid&gt; -d &lt;dest_eid&gt; -t
  &lt;type&gt; -p &lt;payload&gt;
options:
 -s &lt;eid|demux_string&gt; source eid)
 -d &lt;eid|demux_string&gt; destination eid)
 -r &lt;eid|demux_string&gt; reply to eid)
 -t &lt;f|m|d&gt; payload type: file, message, or date
 -p &lt;filename|string&gt; payload data
 -v verbose
 -h help
 -n copies of the bundle to send
 -e request for end-to-end return receipt
 -f request for bundle forwarding receipts
 -w wait for bundle status reports
 -i registration id for reply to
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
To use <tt>dtnsend</tt>, you need to give it a source and
destination. Then you tell it what kind of data to send, and
where to find it. You may use other command line options to
set some optional flags in the bundle.

<p>
First, let's send in a little test message that we will be
able to see inside the daemon, and then will be able to fetch with
<tt>dtnrecv</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtnsend/dtnsend -s bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/me
    -d bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/testing
    -t m -p "testing"</font></pre></blockquote>

<p> You can use a command like that, but instead of using the example
hostname <i>dtn-a</i>, use the local eid you configured in your
dtn.conf file. When you run <tt>dtnsend</tt>, you should see a line
like this show up in the window where dtnd is running:

<blockquote><pre>[1109563831.574628 /route info] BUNDLE_RECEIVED id:0 (7 of 7 bytes)</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In that window, type "bundle list". You should get something
like this:

<blockquote><pre>dtn% <font color=blue>bundle list</font>
Currently Pending Bundles (1):
        0  : bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/me -&gt; bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/testing length 7
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
There's a couple things to note here. First, see how the bundle is
shown with length 7? That's what we'd expect, because we sent a
payload from the command line of the letters "testing". The bundle
consists of <b>exactly</b> those 7 letters. There's no terminating
NUL character, nor a newline. Second, notice that our eids now have
an extra string on them, in contast to the local eid we set in
the configuration file in the first tutorial. It's easiest to think of
these as the equivalent of TCP ports. For more details on how
addressing works in the DTN world, see the <a href="arch.html">
architecture</a> section of the manual. 

<p>
In another window, go take a look behind the scenes at the
directory where you told dtnd to store the bundles in transit. You should
find a file there named bundle_0.dat. It should be no surprise by
now that this file is 7 bytes long, and contains the string
"testing". Generally, you'll never need to do anything with the
files in this directory. They are managed by dtnd for you. But
it's always nice to have an idea what's going on, so now you know.

<p>
So now we've gotten a bundle into the system, and the bundle has
made it's way across the DTN to its final destination. "Big deal", you
say, "the final destination is the same place we put it in!". Ok,
you've got a point. But later we'll try something fancier and
with some imagination, you'll be able to pretend you've sent a
bundle all the way to Mars. Before that though, we've got to get our
bundle back out. And for that, we use <tt>dtnrecv</tt>.

<p>
The usage of <tt>dtnrecv</tt> is much easier to remember than
that of <tt>dtnsend</tt>. You only need to tell it the name of
the endpoint who's bundles you want to pick up. Because
<tt>dtnrecv</tt> cannot pick up bundles from across the DTN, but only
on the local node, it's options are much simpler.

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtnrecv/dtnrecv testing</font>
opening connection to dtn router...
opened connection to dtn router...
calling dtn_build_local_eid.
local_eid [internet host://dtn-a/testing]

<font color=blue>Ctrl-C</font></pre></blockquote>

<p>
As before, there's a couple of things to note here. First, notice
how <tt>dtnrecv</tt> was able to figure out the local eid for the
local dtnd, and them add the argument onto the end to make the
complete eid. It did that by asking the local server what its
local eid is. The second thing to notice is that the answer 
did indeed come back correctly. The 7 bytes we put into the DTN
with <tt>dtnsend</tt> came back out with <tt>dtnrecv</tt>. Finally,
note that <tt>dtnrecv</tt> stayed running until we killed it with
Ctrl-C. It was waiting for more bundles for that endpoint to arrive.

<p>
Turn your attention to the window where dtnd is running. Type
"bundle list" again and notice that there are no currently
pending bundles. Great! The server did it's job and held the
bundle until an application registered and requested that
bundles for that endpoint get delivered. This is a key difference
between sending data with TCP or UDP and sending data over a DTN.
In a DTN, every part of the network, from the link protocols up
to the applications themselves need to recognize and tolerate
delays and disruptions. Typically applications do this by
operating asynchronously. Another way applications can operate
is by arranging with the DTN bundle router to make a callback
to the application when bundles arrive.
<i>Stay tuned for a future
tutorial showing how that works when I figure it out myself! -jra
</i>

<h3> Other payload types </h3>

<p> In the example above, we used the "-t m" parameter to indicate we
wanted to specify the bundle contents from the command line.  But what
if you wanted to send a movie through a DTN? You'd want to use "-t f"
to indicate you are sending a file, then the argument following "-p"
will be interpreted as a filename. dtnd will open that file and read
it in to fill up the bundle. Be aware that dtnd needs to make a copy
of your file and put it in the bundle directory, even if your file is
quite big. Once dtnd has gotten another server someplace else in the
DTN to take custody of the bundle, it will be deleted from the local
server. (However, custody transfer is not currently implemented in DTN2.)

<p>
The final payload type is "d", for date. When you use this,
you do not need -p. A payload consisting of the date is made up
automatically for you. This is useful for testing, but not for much
else.

<h3> Getting a receipt, waiting for it to arrive </h3>

<i>To fully understand this section, you should quit and restart your
dtnd process, otherwise you will get unexpected results due to state
that is not properly cleaned up from the above tests. -demmer</i>

<p>
If you add the -e and -w options to the <tt>dtnsend</tt> command
above, something different happens. The -e argument asks the
far end DTN server (in this case, still our local server) to
make up a receipt and send it via the DTN back to our reply
address. Because we did not use the -r argument to explicitly
set a reply address, the receipt will come to the source eid
we specified with the -s option. The -w argument tells
<tt>dtnsend</tt> to wait for incoming messages to the reply
endpoint. So, here's an example of it in action:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtnsend/dtnsend -e -w -s bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/me
    -d bundles://internet/host://dtn-a/testing
    -t m -p "testing"</font>
got 67 byte report from [internet host://dtn-a]: time=18893.0 ms
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
18.893 seconds?!? What kind of broken network could possibly take
18.893 seconds to deliver a little 7 byte bundle? What's going on here?

<p>
Well, recall that this is a disruption tolerant network, and that
the application on the other end may not have been running at the time
we sent the message. In fact it was not. The 18 seconds was how long
it took me to find another window and run <tt>dtnrecv</tt>. (So
I type slow. Sue me.) The dtnd server couldn't create and send a
receipt until it had delivered the bundle to the final destination,
which in this case was the <tt>dtnrecv</tt> process that I started
a few seconds after I ran <tt>dtnsend</tt>. If I'd had my
<tt>dtnrecv</tt> up and running before I ran <tt>dtnsend</tt> the
receipt would have arrived in just a few milliseconds.

<h2>dtncp and dtncpd</h2>

<p>
What if you wanted to move a file to another node on the DTN?
You've have to have someone logged into that machine ready to run
<tt>dtnrecv</tt> on it. And of course, you can't log in to it,
because the other bundle router is on the other side of Mars.
And of course, you can't put your buddy there to run the command,
because, well, it's on the other side of Mars. What to do? If
there was a daemon there listening for bundles arriving on
a certain endpoint, and you had a program that could package up
local files and send them to the endpoint the far side was
waiting on, you could move files!

<p>
That's exactly how <tt>dtncp</tt> and <tt>dtncpd</tt> work.
<tt>dtncp</tt> is used to pick up a file from the local
filesystem send it as a bundle.
<tt>dtncpd</tt> is the daemon, which would stay running
all the time. It registers with the local bundle router
requesting a notification when a bundle comes in that was sent
by <tt>dtncp</tt>. It copies the bundle into an "incoming files"
directory. Voila, you've copied a file.

<p>
You need to run a <tt>dtncpd</tt> on every node in the
network where you want to be able to copy files. If a node
is only sending out files, it need not have a <tt>dtncpd</tt>
running.

<p>
Note that <tt>dtncpd</tt> is not a general purpose file copy
system like <tt>scp</tt>. It can only deposit files into a
specific directory. It was written this way because it is an
example application, and implementing the security-critical
parts of a general file transfer utility were beyond the scope
of the example. Likewise, there's no facility to run remote
commands on the remote node. It would be possible to add
some kind of flag to the bundle contents specifying whether
or not to run the received file (and with which arguments).
These are all possibilities for bundle applications you might
choose to make in the future.

<h3> An example </h3>

<p>
In one window, we get a directory ready for <tt>dtncpd</tt>
to put files into, then start it. <tt>dtncpd</tt> registers
on the endpoint <i>/dtncp/recv:*</i>, then waits for incoming
files.

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>mkdir /home/fred/dtn/incoming</font>
$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtncpd/dtncpd /home/fred/dtn/incoming</font>
opening connection to dtn router...
local_eid [internet host://dtn-a/dtncp/recv:*]
dtn_register succeeded, regid 0xa
dtn_recv [internet host://dtn-a/dtncp/recv:*]...
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
In another window, we copy a file:

<blockquote><pre>$ <font color=blue>DTN2/apps/dtncp/dtncp /etc/motd bundles://internet/host://dtn-a</font></pre></blockquote>

<p>
And in the first window, <tt>dtncpd</tt> says:

<blockquote><pre>======================================
 File Received at Sun Mar  6 01:03:24 2005

   region : internet
   host   : dtn-a
   path   :
   file   : motd
   size   : 960 bytes
   loc    : /home/fred/dtn/incoming/dtn-a//passwd</pre></blockquote>

<p>
You may also give <tt>dtncp</tt> a third argument, which will
be the filename on the far side. The default, if you neglect
to provide this argument, is to make the far side file have the
same name as the local file.

<h3> Wildcard endpoints </h3>

<p>
The DTN2 implementation treats <b>*</b> (asterisk) as a
special character in endpoints. The asterisk denotes
that any endpoint that matches the prefix before the asterix
will match that endpoint. <tt>dtncpd</tt> uses a wildcard
endpoint to be able to match the endpoints that <tt>dtncp</tt>
makes by adding the desired remote filename onto the end of
the first part of the endpoint string, <i>/dtncp/recv:</i>.

<p>
Another place you'll find wildcard endpoints used
is in the <i>link</i> command. Read <a href="tutorial-3.html">
Building a bigger DTN</a> for examples of using the
<i>link</i> command.
