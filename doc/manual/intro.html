<h1>Introduction </h1>

<p>
Congratulations! Welcome to the world of Disruption Tolerant
Networking. With a little help from this manual, and the DTN2
software, you'll soon be sending bundles to Mars and beyond.

<h2> What is Disruption Tolerant Networking? </h2>

<p> The protocols that govern the way computers talk on the Internet
largely assume that there are reliable low latency connections
between any two points on the net. But several applications where we'd
like to get the benefits of computer networking do not conform to that
assumption. For instance, when NASA sends an instruction to a Mars
Rover, there are both latency (speed of light delay) and disruption
problems (no line of sight from Earth to Mars because the rover is on
the back side of Mars right now, or it is the weather is bad at the
receiving station). Another example is the challenge of
getting the benefits of the Internet to a villiage in a developing
nation. Traditional
telecommunications technology cannot reach it cost-effectively, but a guy
on a motorcycle can visit twenty such villages in a week much more cheaply
than one could build a network to those twenty villages. 

<p>The Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) family of specifications
and protocols lay out an architecture and mechanism to keep data
moving even in the face of the difficulties these new environments
present. For more information on DTN, visit the <a
href="http://dtnrg.org">DTN Research Group</a> web page. In
particular, download and read <a
href="http://dtnrg.org/tutorials/warthman-1.1.pdf">Forrest Warthman's
tutorial</a> for a great introduction to all the concepts and
terms in the DTN world.  

<h2> What is DTN2? </h2>

<p> DTN2 is the name for a reference implementation of the DTN
protocols.  It is designed as an experimental platform where
researchers can validate the protocol designs, and do experiments to
show that the DTN protocols are working as expected. For more
information about DTN2's architecture and role as a platform for
experimentation, see <a
href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~demmer/papers/dtn-irb-tr-04-020.pdf">this
paper</a> by Michael Demmer and others.

<p> Though DTN2 appeals to researchers, it is also intended to be
high-quality, production-grade code ready for use in real world
deployments. It has already been deployed to Cambodia and India
as part of the <a href="http://tier.cs.berkeley.edu">TIER,
Project</a>, to Swedish Lapland  as part of the 
<a href="http://www.n4c.eu/">N4C</a> project, and we
hope to see it deployed to many other environments that need to
benefits of a DTN.

<h2> What protocols does DTN2 implement? </h2>

<p>
DTN2 primarily implements The DTN Bundle Protocol defined in the experimental 
specification <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5050.txt">RFC 5050</a>. 
An RFC 5050-based DTN transmits data in the form of <i>bundles</i> that may be 
much larger 
than typical packets transmitted on IP networks.  DTN2 also optionally supports 
the Bundle Security Protocol to provide authentication and/or integrity 
protection for transmitted bundles if required by the application.  Bundles 
can be transmitted over either over (IP) transport layers or various link layers
including Ethernet and Bluetooth.  DTN2 implements a number of <i>convergence
layers</i> that interface between the Bundle Protocol and the transports.  DTN2
also provides a number of routing mechanisms to direct the forwarding of 
bundles to their intended destinations including a <i>static</i> routing
scheme based on pre-configured routes and <i>epidemic</i> routing which 
floods bundles to any node it encounters.

<h2> What happened to DTN1? </h2>

<p>
We have ceased working on DTN1 in favor of DTN2, which has a
significantly improved architecture for experimentation. DTN1 is
still available from the <a href="http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/Code">DTN Research
Group</a> home page. You really should be using DTN2 for
any new experiments or deployments.
