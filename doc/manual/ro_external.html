ExternalRouter provides a plug-in interface for third-party
routing protocol implementations.Events received from BundleDaemon 
are serialized into XML messages and UDP multicasted to external 
bundle router processes. XML actions received on the interface are 
validated, transformed into events, and placed on the global event 
queue. For more information please see the <a href="configuration.html#ecla">ecla</a> command.
