About logging in DTN2
---------------------

The DTN2 implementation uses the logging facility from
oasys. It supports multiple log paths and different log
levels for each log path.

If the file ~/.dtndebug exists, it can be used to customize
which log messages are emitted and which ignored. It is read
one line at a time. Lines may start with "#" to indicate a
comment. Blank lines are ignored. Any other line should have
a logpath in the left column, and a log level in the right
column.  For instance, this .dtndebug file makes the default
level info, but causes debug info to be printed for all link
operations other than for tcp0.

	/		info
	/link/tcp0	info
	/link		debug

In dtnd, the log messages go out to stdout, by default. You can
change that using the "-o filename" option. 

Here is an incomplete list of log paths used by the DTN2
implementation:

/dtnd			dtnd server startup/operation
/dtnserver		dtnd internals
/interface		interface management
/link/$linkname		link management
/storage/$dbtype	database operations
/route			routing related messages
/tcl			Errors from TCL (the underlying interpreter)
/assert			Failing assertions
/apisrv			API Server
/apisrv/sock		API Server (socket-specific messages)
/cl/tcp			TCP Convergence Layer
/cl/tcp/conn/$ip:$port	connection specific messages
/cl/udp			UDP Convergence Layer
/contact/bundles
/registration

Here is the list of logging levels:

	debug
	info
	warn, warning
	err, error
	crit, critical
	always
