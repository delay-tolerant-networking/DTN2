\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

In this document, we describe a DTN reference system architecture.  The purpose
of this document is to identify the components of the DTN reference system, 
and to define and specify the semantics of the interfaces between the 
components.  
%We seek feedback from the DTN community on the architecture and
%the interfaces described here, for possible inclusion in future versions of
%this document.

The reader is assumed to be familiar with the Bundle Protocol
specification~\cite{BP-ID}, the Bundle Security Protocol
specification~\cite{BSP-ID}, and the DTNRG reference
implementation~\cite{DTN2}.  

A particular goal of this architecture is to enable the community to experiment
with multiple solutions for persistent storage, routing, naming and late
binding, policy, and DTN convergence layers, while continuing to build upon a
common core of open DTNRG standards and software. This is accomplished by
defining interfaces that allow the experimental features to plug into the
common core.  In this document, the term {\em system} will refer to the
SPINDLE-II DTN system (the core of which is based on the DTN2 system), unless
specified otherwise.

The system SHOULD contain the following components (described in
Section \ref{sec:compdesc}):

\vspace{-4pt}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\parskip}{-3pt}
\item Bundle Protocol Agent (BPA), a DTNRG-public component
\item Data Store (DS)
\item Decision Plane (DP)
\item Convergence Layer Adapter (CLA)
\item Application/Middleware (A/M)
\end{enumerate}

Table \ref{tab:comp-functions} summarizes the key functionality provided by
each of the five components. The above components MAY be implemented in
separate processes to enable language and tool-chain independence across
components. 

Instances of the BPA will be also referred to as the {\it core} and instances
of the other four components shall be referred to as {\it plugins}.  The DS
SHOULD provide a service that is accessible from all other components of the
system.\footnote{As a result, the system can support both daemon-centric and
database-centric concepts of operation.}

The system MUST implement the relevant DTNRG-public interfaces as name below
and described in Section \ref{sec:interfaces}:
\vspace{-4pt}
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength{\parskip}{-3pt}
\item Data Store Interface (used by BPA, CLA, DP, and A/M)
\item Decision Plane Interface (used by BPA)
\item Convergence Layer Adapter Interface (used by BPA)
\item Bundle Protocol Agent Interface (used by A/M)
\end{enumerate}

All interfaces SHOULD be provided using the Inter-Component Communication 
protocol (discussed in Section \ref{sec:iccp}, defined in a separate document)
for uniformity.

\section{Architectural Components} \label{sec:compdesc}

In this section we describe each of the system components mentioned in Section
\ref{sec:complist} (DS, CLA, DP, A/M). These will be implemented as plug-ins in
the SPINDLE-II system; in other words, a newly developed module (implemented as
a process) can be started on the node and its services will be automatically
available to the other already running DTN processes.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Bundle Protocol Agent}
\label{sec:bpa}

The bundle protocol agent (BPA) of a DTN node offers bundle protocol (BP)
services.  The BPA executes procedures of the BP and the Bundle Security
Protocol (BSP) with help from other components in the system.  The BPA MUST
comply with the DTNRG specifications for the BP~\cite{BP-ID} and the BSP
~\cite{BSP-ID}.  

The BPA is responsible for implementing the mechanisms of the bundle protocol,
but any key decisions (for example, those based on particular policies or
optimization strategies) that need to be taken during the execution of such
mechanisms MAY be exported to the {\em Decision Plane (DP)} module.  Typically
these decisions are indicated within the BP and BSP specifications as local
policy or implementation issues.

The BPA is responsible for taking actions on every bundle that passes through 
the DTN node.   For example, the BPA is responsible for reading, creating, 
and updating fields in the bundle header.

A comprehensive list of functional requirements for the BPA in terms of
conformance to the BP and BSP can be found in a companion document \cite{MJ}.
Some key functions are:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Forwarding a bundle to a ``next-hop'' node via a specified convergence
layer adapter.  The BP specification talks about forwarding to the ``minimum
reception group'' for each bundle in each of the unicast, multicast, and
anycast scenarios. The DP must compute these lists and returns them to the BPA
along with scheduling instructions to handle ``Class of Service'' requirements.

\item Fragmentation and reassembly of bundle payload (both reactive and 
pro-active).

\item Implementation of the Custody-transfer mechanism in the bundle header,
sending Custody Acknowledgments, etc.: The decision of whether to accept,
refuse, or relinquish custody is taken by the DP. Once a decision has been
made, a list of DP-specified actions such as re-forwarding the bundle may have
to be taken (depends on policy).

\item Delivery to application: Deliver incoming bundle to application if it is
{\it registered} on this node; otherwise abandon delivery based on policy.

\item Discarding and Deleting a bundle: If the set of ``retention
constraints'' on a bundle is empty, then discard the bundle and all references
to it. Deleting a bundle involves removing all retention constraints and then
discarding it.  This may happen upon bundle expiration. These mechanisms can
richly interact with the policy module within the DP.

\item Sending administrative bundles such as status reports.

\item Security functions such as authentication, confidentiality, 
and data integrity.
%prevention of DOS over resource strapped networks.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the BPA SHOULD {\it implement} the Bundle Protocol Agent Interface that
can be accessed by applications, and {\it use} the other interfaces listed in
Section \ref{sec:complist}.

%The interactions between the BPA and other components are described in 
%Section \ref{sec:XXX}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Data Store}
\label{sec:ds}

The Data Store (DS) module offers a persistent storage service and is
responsible for storing bundles, knowledge about bundle metadata, network state
information (routing tables, name ontology data, content metadata, policy
rules), and application state information (registrations and other metadata).
We note that the SPINDLE system may eventually need to cater to a wide spectrum
of solutions for the data storage layer. These may range from a dumb file
system residing on Flash memory attached to a low power sensor node to a very
powerful logic engine running on a powerful DTN node.  Hence a DS in the
SPINDLE system could exist in one of the following incarnations of increasing
capability: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item A simple key-value store (that can be based on a file system) that allows 
other modules to add, retrieve and delete key-value pairs. Bundles, bundle metadata 
and network state information can exist in such a store. This may be 
applicable for resource-strapped devices such as battery-powered sensor 
nodes.

\item A DBMS that allows other modules to add, delete, and get
elements with multiple fields information (by its key). An DBMS might 
expose only {\it canned queries} to other modules, or it might allow other 
modules to submit queries, e.g. written in SQL.

\item A full fledged knowledge base (KB) that supports deduction or inference
by means of execution of rules (e.g., Prolog style) on stored facts. In
addition to add/delete(key)/get(key) features, a KB will support advanced
deductive database style querying features. Advanced KBs like Flora-2 even
allow setting up ``triggers'' that fire when a certain rule executes
successfully, and this typically results in the execution of a specified
callback function.  A KB will include support for data storage, either
internally, or via a back-end storage system such as MySQL or Berkeley DB.

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Decision Plane} \label{sec:dp}

The Decision Plane component includes the following subcomponents which may
interact with each other:

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\it Router module:} Functions of a Router module include unicast and
multicast route computation, generation of next hop(s) for bundles, replication
and forwarding, bundle scheduling, decision to take custody of a bundle,
decision to discard a bundle, etc. 

Note that while the BPA performs the forwarding mechanism to a particular CLA,
it is the Router module that performs the consulting role for the BPA.  Similarly,
for custody transfer, the BPA performs the mechanism of assuming and
relinquishing custody and sending a custody-ACK to the previous node, but it
consults the external router module to decide whether to take custody or not.

\item {\it Adaptive Dissemination module:} This is responsible for determining
{\it what} network state to distribute, and {\it to whom}, and {\it when}. It
is also responsible for gathering network state encoded in incoming
dissemination bundles and populating the KB appropriately, if one exists. For
example, decisions such as whether to alter the content of a flooded
network-state bundle before re-dissemination will be taken by this module. This
module is also responsible for interacting with CLA (via the BPA) to track
changes in the status of incoming/outgoing links and then capture these changes
in the ``to-be-disseminated'' network state.  Even though the network state is
stored in the KB, the dissemination logic may be implemented outside the KB for
performance reasons, if necessary.

\item {\it Policy module:} This will let users add and delete policies that may
be stored in the KB, if one exists. Basic functions include interpretation of
policy, enforcement of policy, and dispatching an event afterward. Performance
reasons aside, ideally every bundle or network event in the SPINDLE system
should be subjected to policy enforcement. This advocates a
``trap-and-dispatch'' (or ``event-condition-action'') style design.  An 
alternative style is that of ``consultation.'' The policy module listens on 
a well known port for policy-enforcement requests
and reacts only when asked.

\item {\it Naming and Late binding module:} This module maintains and
opportunistically shares name ontologies (or {\it schemes}, as referred to
in~\cite{BP-ID}) between DTN nodes. This module is called upon to resolve rich
intentional names to canonical endpoint identifiers of care-of nodes that are
subsequently used by the Router module. This is also responsible for
registration and dissemination or synchronization of Name KBs (in particular,
intentional name to canonical name bindings stored within).

\item {\it Content-based access module:} responsible for performing content
caching/replication, distributed indexing, and content-addressable search.
This may use several services from other DP modules, e.g., dissemination, late
binding, external router.

%{\it does this fall under Decision or App? Or maybe there should be no
%distinction?}

\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Convergence Layer Adapter}
\label{sec:cla}

A Convergence layer adapter's function (as described in \cite{BP-ID}) is to
send and receive bundles on behalf of the BPA. It achieves this by utilizing
the services of the native protocol which is supported in one of the {\it
underlying} networks that the node is homed on. A CLA thus {\it adapts} the
packet/frame/signal transmission service provided in the underlying network to
an abstract bundle transmission service that presents itself to the BPA.  

A CLA is responsible for maintaining information about DTN {\it links} (status,
schedule, and possibly other QoS parameters) and discover them if possible.
After discovering a DTN peer or monitoring the status of a link, the CLA is
responsible for generating and posting events to the BPA about such facts.
These facts then get relayed to the DP and may also be stored in the DS. 

%The CLA may also interact directly (IPC poke?) with some decision modules
%(adaptive dissemination) for triggered dissemination under certain
%circumstances. 

%{\it What is the service contract of send/receive with the BP? and how are the
%CLA params presented to BP?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Application/Middleware}
\label{sec:am}

The application agent (also referred to as the A/M module) uses the BP services
to transmit and receive bundle payloads. This can act as a multiplexed DTN
communication service to other non-DTN applications running on the node.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newpage
\section{Interfaces}
\label{sec:interfaces}

In this section we describe the primitives for each of the four interfaces 
identified in Figure \ref{fig:componly}.  

The BPA implements the BPA interface that can be used by A/M and DP to send and
receive bundles.  

The DP implements the DP interface that is accessed by the BPA to serve various
decision points identified in the BP (such as routing, scheduling, name
resolution, custody acceptance, and storage management).

The DS implements the DS interface for storing bundles, bundle metadata,
application registrations, connectivity information, and other system state.
The DS interface can be accessed system-wide.  The CLA, for example, may access
the DS interface for storing and retrieving connectivity information that is
discovered or scheduled/specified.  The DP, for example, may access the DS
interface for storing and retrieving information related to routing, naming,
policy, and content caching/indexing.

The CLA implements the CLA interface which is accessed by the BPA for 
bundle transport and link management.

We briefly discuss at the end of this section the Inter-Component 
Communication Protocol (ICCP), the details of which will be described 
in a separate document.

\subsection{Interface Conventions}

We note that this is a ``semantic'' interface, that is, we expect it to be
specifying the kinds of things that go across the interface and their meanings,
not necessarily at a level necessary for implementation. We expect, though,
that an implementation-level specification can be generated from this easily.

All messages are assumed to be transparently reliably delivered.  This
functionality may be provided by the inter-component communication protocol
mentioned in Section \ref{sec:iccp}.

All parameters are assumed to be ``required'' unless specifically
noted to be ``optional'' (Opt).

The interface messages are named in a top-down hierarchical
fashion. For example, in the DP and CLA interfaces, at the highest
level, there are four kinds of messages: Event, Request, Query,
Report. At the next level, there are Link-specific and Bundle-specific
messages, for each message type. At a further level, there is
Created/Deleted, Transmitted/Received etc. which are 
the next level down.  This naming convention is intended for readability 
of the specification only. The implementation should adopt/retain the style
most convenient to it.

Query/Report messages consist of a set of ``paired'' messages---a Query
message from a plugin to the BPA requesting certain information from the BPA
and a report message (for that query) from the BPA to the plugin delivering the
requested information, if possible.\footnote{Note that Query/Report messages are
possible in the reverse direction as well, e.g., the BPA can send a Query
message to the CLA or the DS and can expect a Report back.} Unlike the
Request-Event messages which are only loosely tied, there is a tighter coupling
between query and report; in particular, a report identifies which query is
being responded to.

\subsubsection{Links and Link Types} \label{sec:linktypes}

A link in DTN2 is an association between two DTN endpoints. In other words it
can be represented as a relation between two EIDs which is established over a
certain convergence layer. A link possesses physical attributes such as
datarate, (estimated) delay, error rate, loss rate etc. as well as other
attributes including {\it type}, {\it state}, and other {\it flags}.  A 
measurement process (in the convergence layer adapter) can track and 
update the values of these attributes.

\caption{\label{table:link-tsf} Link types and possible states/flags.}
\end{table}
\footnotetext{Anticipated changes in the way bundle queuing is done for 
closed links might make the REACHABLE flag unnecessary. Thus this column 
is likely to disappear in future versions.}

There are three link types implemented in DTN2: Persistent (AlwaysOn),
On-demand, and Opportunistic (Discovered).\footnote{DTN2 uses AlwaysOn
to denote what the DTN Architecture refers to as Persistent;
``Discovered'' is influenced by the term   
``neighbor discovery'' commonly used in mobile ad hoc networking literature.}
We extend the semantics of the Opportunistic link to support a wider range 
of neighbor discovery procedures.  We add the
remaining two types discussed in the DTN Architecture: Scheduled, and
Predicted.\footnote{
There is a Scheduled link type in DTN2 but it is not fully implemented.}
Not all link states and flags apply to all link types.\footnote{In
particular, note that there is no discovery for on-demand links, and
reachability is assumed.} Table \ref{table:link-tsf} depicts the various {\it
types} of links and their corresponding range of {\it states} and {\it flags}
that SHOULD be allowed in a DTN system. A detailed description of the various
link states and flags can be found in Section \ref{sec:linkstates}.

A Persistent (AlwaysOn) link is simply a static link, and it should always 
be open. The
link is opened as soon as it is created. If the link closes for any reason the
link becomes UNAVAILABLE and the BPA will attempt to reopen the link.
An example of an AlwaysOn link would be a wired connection to a peer such as a
T1. 

An On-demand link is assumed to be usable at any time as required, but is not
opened until there are bundles to be sent over the link. When in this state,
the link is AVAILABLE. Once the link is OPEN, if no bundle traffic is sent over
an on-demand link for a while, the BPA will consider the link idle and
automatically close the link, returning it to AVAILABLE. If the link closes for
any reason other than being idle or being explicitly closed by an operator, the
link becomes UNAVAILABLE and the BPA will periodically attempt to reopen the
link. If the link is successfully reopened, the link state returns to OPEN. A
dial-up connection over a modem would be represented by an
on-demand link.

An Opportunistic (Discovered) link is used with CLAs when there is no need 
to form a {\em point-to-point} connection for a link to be open.   
Discovered links are intended to capture characteristics of communications in 
multihop broadcast wireless networks (MANETs). Note that
in a broadcast channel context there really is no ``link'' {\it per se,} but peers
discover ability to communicate, which we declare as links. 
%We shall assume, as
%is consistent with current state of art, that the CLA only discovers and
%uses two-way communication possibilities. 
% XXX:  I think above sentence is too strong, I can imagine CLAs that 
% discover one-way communication possibilities through an out-of-band 
% mechanism; --krash
One
popular way of peer discovery is using a Hello protocol~\cite{OLSR}, where each
node puts the set of nodes it can hear in the Hello, to help determine
existence of bidirectional communications. Thus, receiving a hello is {\em not}
an indication of bidirectional communications, although it is a necessary
condition.

Discovered links may be constrained, for example, in a ``only k links out 
of n'' situation.  
%As long as the CLA can transmit on any k---it need not transmit 
%simultaneously, but may transmit in round robin. 
If the situation calls for choosing a particular set of k links and
locking out the other (for example, if a CLA knows which satellites it
can associate with but can do so only k at a time), then these would
not be Discovered links by definition (they are not for point to point
links).\footnote{In a one-of-many link situation A $\rightarrow$
one-of(B,C,D), the ``choosing'' is either ``hard'' (i.e., you cannot
send on the other links for more than a threshold period of time), or
``soft'' (you can do round robin).  With hard links the DP has to
first choose the link to use (this may be part of topology control),
say A $\rightarrow$ C. In this case, both A $\rightarrow$ D and A
$\rightarrow$ B are both closed and unreachable. With soft links you
can keep the links open and send on each within milliseconds of each
other.  In the current semantics, Discovered links only cover the
``soft type'', that is, when all can be kept open and reachable.}

Thus, with discovered links, any time a peer is
reachable, bundles can be transmitted or received without any additional
action, so the link is always OPEN if it is REACHABLE. The link will remain
open if the peer becomes
unreachable temporarily, but if the peer remains unreachable for a long time,
then the link can be considered closed, and the state will be changed to
UNAVAILABLE (the closed state).

Note that a special case of the Opportunistic link is implemented in DTN2
which is subsumed by the more general semantics discussed above.  In the 
current implementation, links are created and opened when a previously 
unknown peer somehow connects to the node to open a link.  If it can be 
inferred from this connection that traffic can be sent from the node to this 
peer, an opportunistic link is created and opened so that bundles may be sent 
to the new peer. Once an opportunistic link is closed for any reason, it 
becomes UNAVAILABLE and will only be reopened if the peer opens the
link again. An example of an opportunistic link is one created when a peer
opens a TCP or dial-up connection to the node; the node now knows it can
communicate with and send bundles to the peer that initiated the first
connection, and represents this fact with an opportunistic link. 

Scheduled links can be thought of as an extension to on-demand links. When a
scheduled link is created, it is set to AVAILABLE. This means the link is
available to be opened.
%Unlike on-demand though, the opening is not under any user's control but under
%the control of the ``clock''. When the scheduled time comes, it moves
%automatically into state OPENING. There it waits for a contactUpEvent just
%like the on-demand link. When this event happens, it moves into OPEN.
When the scheduled time comes, the BPA will open the link. (This adds a 
new requirement to the functionality of the BPA.)
\typeout{XXX If this new requirement is hard, DP can track schedule and open
at the right instant.} A
scheduled link is expected to be reachable during the scheduled interval.  If
the link is still scheduled to be open when it closes, it becomes UNAVAILABLE,
and otherwise it becomes AVAILABLE until the next time the link is scheduled to
be opened. If the link is UNAVAILABLE and the link is scheduled to be open,
the BPA will try to reopen the link,
like it does for UNAVAILABLE on-demand links, until the end of the scheduled
opportunity. During the time the link is scheduled to be open, if the CLA can
ascertain reachability, the REACHABLE flag can be used to provide extra
information to the DP. A scheduled link would represent, for example,
communications with a satellite which is overhead at regular intervals.

A predicted link is similar to a discovered link. When created, it is
UNAVAILABLE. A separate process (perhaps in the DP) computes the next time it
expects the link to be REACHABLE. However,
that is used for DP purposes only to make routing decisions, and the link is
not opened automatically when the predicted time arrives. Instead, the
discovery process
%(hellos)
is initiated shortly before the predicted time by the CLA.
%When you hear back from the contact, a contactUpEvent forces the state into
%OPEN. Then the OPEN to BUSY transition and the transitions to UNAVAILABLE are
%as in discovered links.
When the neighbor becomes reachable, the link becomes OPEN and then behaves
like a discovered link: it is OPEN until the peer is unreachable for too long,
at which point the link is closed and set to UNAVAILABLE. At the end of the
predicted opportunity, discovery for the peer is discontinued. The difference
between discovered and predicted links is that for predicted links we don't
initiate discovery until the predicted time (or shortly before). For CLAs where
the discovery process is continuous (e.g.\ MANETs), there is no functional
difference in the CLA between predicted links and discovered links, but even in
this case, the DP can make decisions based on whether a link has a predicted
opportunity or not. A regularly observed UAV flyover would be described
by a predicted link.

\subsubsection{Link States and Flags} \label{sec:linkstates}

The DP and CLA interfaces make use of four link states present in DTN2:
UNAVAILABLE, AVAILABLE, OPEN, and BUSY.\footnote{DTN2 also has an OPENING state
used for determining whether ContactDownEvent should be sent, but this state
need not be used in the interface. The CLA posts EventLinkClosed and the BPA
may need to keep track of on-demand links for which the RequestOpenLink message
has been sent and EventLinkOpen has not been received yet, but in the external
interface the link is simply not OPEN until the EventLinkOpen message has
arrived.} The link can be in only one of these four states at a given time. Two
additional states are added: UNUSABLE and REACHABLE. These two states are
independent of the other four, so the link state should be considered a set of
flags.

The OPEN and BUSY \typeout{XXX We may want to revisit the idea of changing
BUSY into a flag distinct from OPEN.} states signify that the
link is open.  For links whose CLA requires a specific action to be done before
communication can happen (e.g.\ dialout, set up a TCP connection, initiate a
route discovery on a MANET to a remote node, etc.), these states mean that
whatever needs to be done has been done and bundles can be sent on the link.
For Discovered links, these states indicate that the peer is or very recently
was reachable.  If the link is BUSY, the CLA is applying back-pressure to the
BPA by requesting that the BPA not try to send any more bundles over the
link.\footnote{In DTN2 this is set when the per-CLA bundle queue gets too long
or as part of LinkAttributeChange Event. The DP would then have to perform a
query to determine whether this has been set.}

Closed links are either UNAVAILABLE or AVAILABLE. The difference between these
two states generally pertains to whether or not the BPA must automatically try
to reopen the link. The state is AVAILABLE is when the link is {\it closed},
but {\it openable}.  UNAVAILABLE is when the link cannot be opened for some
reason. The BPA will periodically attempt to reopen UNAVAILABLE links of the
following types: AlwaysOn, On-demand, and Scheduled. For other link types,
there is only one kind of closed state, so those links are always UNAVAILABLE
when closed.

The availability concept has more to do with the {\it ability} to open a link
rather than policy directives such as ``I think this link is dangerous
(eavesdroppers in there), so you SHOULD not open it even if it can be''. The
latter concept is captured by {\it usability}. A link can be marked with the
UNUSABLE flag based on policy. This flag can be set by the DP. If a link is
marked UNUSABLE, the BPA and DP should not attempt to open it. 
Usability is different from availability in that it is not an
``inability'' but a ``forbidding''. Note that the peer endpoint of an
UNUSABLE link can still open a link and send bundles to the node; those
bundles should be accepted and processed by the node because the UNUSABLE
flag only disallows the local node from opening the link and sending bundles
over it.

The reachability of a link pertains to the ability to actually communicate over
the link and talk to the peer. The DTN neighbor discovery process, if enabled,
will use the underlay network to determine whether other DTN nodes are
reachable. Nodes should provide their canonical EIDs as part of the discovery
process so that links may be created and used in future decisions.  When the
CLA ascertains bidirectional communications with some adequate quality (and
keeps ascertaining it), the link will be marked REACHABLE. If discovery notices
that a neighbor has become unreachable, the REACHABLE flag will be cleared.
The REACHABLE flag is meant to express the communication ability currently
present in the underlay network and is used to inform decisions made by the DP.

\subsection{Inter-Component Communication Protocol} \label{sec:iccp}

Communications between the BPA and other components will use messages
formatted using XML.  We currently plan to build upon and extend the 
external router interface protocol developed by MITRE for this purpose.  
Some extensions to the support the Data Store interface were described in 
Section~\ref{sec:ds-iccp-impl}.  For example, the MITRE solution 
uses UDP multicast, but we believe that it will be beneficial to 
support TCP as well.

Details of this protocol will be described in a separate document.
