\subsection{Bundle Protocol Agent Interface}

The bundle protocol agent interface will use the current DTN2 application 
interface.  We seek feedback on any additional features that are required 
for this interface.

In addition, MITRE is developing an XML-based interface that conforms 
to the ICCP.  The interface being developed is expected to support the 
same primitives as are found in the current RPC-based interface in DTN2.  
We expect the XML-based BPA interface to be included in a future version 
of this document.
